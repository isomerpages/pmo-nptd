**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
ORAL ANSWER  
MONDAY, 16 JANUARY 2012** 

**Mr Arthur Fong:**
To ask the Prime Minister (a) over the last 8 years what was the annual number of employment pass holders employed in the financial services sector who have applied successfully for permanent residence status; (b) what were the top three nationalities of such applicants before they were granted permanent residence; and (c) what are the conditions or situations that can lead to permanent residency being revoked or not renewed.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**
1. From 2003 to 2010, an average of 1,400 applicants employed in the financial services sector was granted Permanent Residence (PR) annually under the Professional, Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers (PTS) Scheme.

2. Of these, the majority were from Asia, with 38% from Southeast Asian countries and 42% from other parts of Asia. The remaining 20% were from regions outside Asia.

3. The Immigration Act sets out the grounds where a personâ€™s PR may be revoked by way of cancellation of his Entry and/or Re-entry permit. ;One example is where a PR has committed an offence.
