**THIRTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
WRITTEN ANSWER  
MONDAY, 2 SEPTEMBER 2019**  

**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:**

To ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider creating honorary citizenships (without benefits and grants/subsidies that Singaporeans are entitled to) for those who have invested in Singapore and created quality jobs for Singaporeans.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**

The Government already confers the Honorary Citizen Award to recognise foreigners who have contributed extensively and significantly to Singapore and its people. Honorary Citizens must be individuals who have a strong affinity towards Singapore, and are highly respected for their professional accomplishments. This is the highest form of national recognition for a foreigner.

Honorary Citizens are accorded privileges, such as the right to reside and work in Singapore.  However, they do not receive grants and subsidies that Singaporeans are entitled to. 

Since 2003, 21 individuals have received this national award.
