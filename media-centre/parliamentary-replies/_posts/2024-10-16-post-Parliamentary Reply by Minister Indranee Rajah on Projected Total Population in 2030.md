<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 16 OCTOBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance given that Singapore’s
total population has now exceeded 6 million, whether the total population
is still projected to reach 6.5 million by 2030 as an infrastructure planning
parameter stated in the Population White Paper released in 2013, notwithstanding
previous clarifications that Singapore’s total population is likely to
be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The infrastructure planning parameter in the 2013 Population White Paper
was 6.9 million by 2030. Based on current trends and the various scenarios
we use to plan for the long term, our total population is expected to remain
significantly below 6.9 million by 2030, as stated at the Committee of
Supply this year.</p>
