<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 14 OCTOBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Victor Lye:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance whether the Ministry
will allow the transfer of unused balances in the Child Development Account
(CDA) into the child's Edusave Account under the Ministry of Education
once a child enters primary school, so that these funds may continue to
support educational needs beyond the preschool years.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The Child Development Account (CDA) and Edusave Account serve different
purposes.</p>
<p>The Edusave scheme was established in 1993 to support the education of
Singaporean students in primary and secondary school. Students can use
their Edusave funds to pay for miscellaneous fees, approved school enrichment
programmes and purchase of learning devices at secondary and pre-university
levels. The Government provides annual contributions and ad-hoc top-ups
to Edusave. Parents who require additional financial support for educational
expenses may apply for financial assistance from MOE.</p>
<p>The CDA was established in 2001 as a special co-savings account to support
parents in managing the cost of raising their children. CDA monies can
be used for preschool and childcare expenses, and for healthcare or developmental
needs at Baby Bonus Approved Institutions, up till the time the child turns
12. As such, transferring unused balances to the child’s Edusave Account
when the child enters primary school, will deprive parents from using the
CDA balance for other purposes.</p>
<p>Taken together, parents can tap on Edusave and CDA to defray their child’s
educational and non-educational expenses during the primary school years.
Unused CDA balances at the end of age 12 will be automatically transferred
to the child’s Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) to continue to support
the child’s educational expenses beyond primary and secondary school.</p>
<p>We will continue to review the uses of CDA to ensure they remain relevant
to parents’ needs.</p>
