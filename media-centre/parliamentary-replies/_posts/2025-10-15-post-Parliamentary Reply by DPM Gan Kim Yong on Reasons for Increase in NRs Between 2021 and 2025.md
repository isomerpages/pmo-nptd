<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 15 OCTOBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what proportion
of the close to 30% increase in non-residents between 2021 and 2025 is
temporary; and (b) what are the reasons for this increase.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>Work Permit Holders (WPHs) accounted for 60% of the increase in the non-resident
population between 2021 and 2025. About half of these were from the Construction
sector, including those supporting the ramp-up of public housing and major
infrastructure projects such as Changi Terminal 5. The next largest increase,
accounting for 13% of the increase in the non-resident population, was
in the number of Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) to meet the greater demand
for caregiving support for children and the elderly. Both WPHs and MDWs
are transient groups.</p>
<p>The 30% increase in non-residents between 2021 to 2025 should also be
interpreted against the context of COVID-19. Border restrictions and weaker
economic conditions contributed to the lower base of non-residents in 2021.
With the subsequent easing of travel restrictions and recovery of economic
activity post-COVID, firms backfilled positions vacated during the pandemic.
This was especially marked in the Construction sector where contractors
hired a significant number of WPHs to catch up on delayed projects. As
such, the annual increase in the non-resident population was 6.8% on average
from 2021 to 2025, compared to 2.2% when using the pre-COVID base year
of 2019.</p>
