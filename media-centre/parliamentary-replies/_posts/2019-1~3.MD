**THIRTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
ORAL ANSWER  
TUESDAY, 5 NOVEMBER 2019**  

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:**

To ask the Prime Minister whether he will allow parents to use the savings in the Child Development Account (CDA) to purchase child car seats.

**Answer**

**Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister):** 

The Child Development Account (CDA) is meant to support the developmental needs of children, such as education and healthcare. Parents can use the CDA to pay for expenses at Approved Institutions such as child care centres, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.

In addition to the CDA, the Government provides a Baby Bonus Cash Gift of $8,000 to $10,000 per child, which parents can use to pay for other items such as child car seats.
