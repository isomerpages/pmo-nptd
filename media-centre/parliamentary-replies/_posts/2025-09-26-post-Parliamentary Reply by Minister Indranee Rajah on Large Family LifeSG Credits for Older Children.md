<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Lee Hong Chuang</strong>:</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government
will consider enhancing the annual disbursement of LifeSG credits under
the Large Families Scheme to eligible children in large families aged seven
to 12.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:</p>
<p>The Large Families Scheme (LFS) was designed based on NPTDâ€™s research
and feedback from parents that they needed more financial support for children
aged 0 to six years old. Accordingly, under the LFS, parents will receive
$1,000 each year in Large Family LifeSG Credits (LFLC) for each third and
subsequent Singapore Citizen child, from the year that the child turns
one to the year that the child turns six.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of financial support for children beyond the first
six years. These include Child Development Account (CDA) Government co-matching,
significant education and healthcare subsidies, parenthood tax benefits,
and top-ups to the CDA, Edusave Account and Post-Secondary Education Account
(PSEA). As part of Budget 2025, all Singapore Citizen children aged 0 to
12 also receive $500 in Child LifeSG Credits, which families can use to
defray their child-raising and household expenses, while those aged 13
to 16 and those aged 17 to 20 receive $500 in their Edusave Account and
PSEA respectively.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to monitor the LFS and consider adjustments
where necessary.</p>
