<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MONDAY, 14 OCTOBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the 2% year-on-year
overall increase in Singapore’s total population as of June 2024 is in
line with the Government’s expectations of population growth rates in the
next five years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>While Singapore’s total population increased by 2% from June 2023 to June
2024, the annualised growth rate over the last five years (2019-2024) has
been lower, at 1.1%. This is in line with our expectation for our total
population to remain significantly below 6.9 million by 2030, as stated
at the Committee of Supply this year.</p>
