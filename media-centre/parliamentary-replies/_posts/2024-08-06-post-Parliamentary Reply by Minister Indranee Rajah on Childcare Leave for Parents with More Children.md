<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 6 AUGUST 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>:</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry
has any plans to increase the childcare leave entitlement for parents of
second or more children as an additional incentive to promote fertility.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:</p>
<p>We recognise that many parents with young children require support in
managing their work and caregiving responsibilities. We have therefore
progressively increased parental leave provisions over the years. The most
recent enhancement was implemented on 1 January 2024, when we doubled Government-Paid
Paternity Leave from two to four weeks on a voluntary basis, and Unpaid
Infant Care Leave from six to 12 days per parent per year in their child’s
first two years. We are presently studying how to strengthen parental leave
support for those with infants who typically have high care needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In considering any enhancement to leave provisions, including increasing
childcare leave for parents with more children, we will need to strike
a balance between supporting the needs of parents and the impact on employers’
manpower and operational requirements. Therefore, beyond legislated leave
provisions, we also encourage other sustainable ways that support parents
in juggling work and caregiving commitments, such as flexible work arrangements
(FWAs). The Tripartite Guidelines on FWA Requests will take effect from
1 December 2024. The mandatory Guidelines will enable employers and employees
to have open discussions and work out arrangements that can meet both parties’
needs and constraints.</p>
<p>It is also critical for our workplaces to have a family-friendly culture,
and we encourage employers, supervisors, and colleagues to be supportive
when working parents need to tap on these measures to care for their children.
On the Government’s part, we will continue to work with Tripartite Partners
and community partners to foster a conducive environment to support Singaporeans’
marriage and parenthood aspirations.</p>
