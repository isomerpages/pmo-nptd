<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong> 
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 2 APRIL 2024</strong> 
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong:</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore’s low fertility reflects a global phenomenon where individual
priorities and societal norms have shifted. We will continue to work with
stakeholders to build a conducive environment where Singaporeans feel supported
along their marriage and parenthood journey. The Member may refer to my
speech at the PMO Committee of Supply Debate on 28 February 2024, where
our strategies have been outlined.</p>
