<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ORAL REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 8 APRIL 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how will the Government
reimagine a “Let’s Have One” campaign to promote growth in birth rate in
a manner similar to the "Stop at Two" family planning campaign launched
in 1972 to moderate population growth then; and (b) what lessons can be
learnt from the "Stop at Two" campaign to make the “Let’s Have One” campaign
as successful for reversing the downward trend in total fertility rate.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>Today’s environment is vastly different compared to the 1970s. Then, we
were a developing country with few resources, insufficient housing and
amenities, and a population with much lower levels of education. Mindsets
and attitudes to family formation too were different.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the half-century that has since passed, Singapore has changed tremendously.
Individual priorities and societal norms surrounding marriage and parenthood
have also shifted, in line with global trends across advanced societies
around the world. As such, using an approach like the “Stop at Two” campaign,
which was developed for circumstances and views prevalent more than 50
years ago, may not be the most effective to change mindsets and attitudes
in the current day.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Addressing our declining fertility is a national priority. Yet, we also
understand that marriage and parenthood are deeply personal decisions.
Young couples have many considerations in deciding whether to marry and
have children. Hence, we are focusing on understanding their viewpoint
and are working to address their concerns over starting and raising families.
We are also working to foster a more conducive and enabling environment
in which Singaporeans feel secure and supported in having children.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Forward Singapore report, we have stated our commitment for Singapore
to be the best place for Singaporeans to start, grow and nurture their
families. Since then, we have progressively enhanced our policies to address
key areas of concerns, for example, through enhancements to the Baby Bonus
Scheme, introduction of the new Shared Parental Leave scheme, the Tripartite
Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests, as well as the new Large
Families Scheme.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To shift mindsets and culture, we have also started the Made For Families
movement, which is an ongoing effort to rally employers, organisations,
community groups, and individuals to create a Singapore where families
can thrive. The Made For Families movement also includes public communications
efforts to encourage conversations around parenthood as well as to assure
those keen to have children that they will be supported at every step along
the way. We will continue to partner the whole-of-society to build a Singapore
Made For Families.</p>
