**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
ORAL ANSWER  
FRIDAY, 18 FEBRUARY 2011**    

#### **STRATEGIES TO INCREASE CITIZEN BIRTH RATE**

**Mr Hri Kumar Nair:** To ask the Prime Minister what new strategies will the Government pursue to increase the fertility rate among Singaporeans.

**DPM Wong Kan Seng (for the Prime Minister):**
The Government made significant enhancements to the Marriage and Parenthood Package in Aug 2008 to provide Singaporeans with more support in getting married, and having and raising children. The enhancements covered a broad range of measures, such as increased maternity and childcare leave, increased Baby Bonus cash gift and cosavings, and increased childcare subsidies. Overall, the package sought to create a more pro-family environment for Singaporean couples.

Given that the enhancements to the Marriage and Parenthood package have been in place for just two and a half years, we should allow more time to assess the impact of these measures. The Government remains committed to supporting Singaporeans in getting married and having children, and we will review the package at an appropriate time in the future. I encourage our young Singaporeans to get married and start a family, and for those who are married, to have more children, so that they can experience the joys of parenthood.
