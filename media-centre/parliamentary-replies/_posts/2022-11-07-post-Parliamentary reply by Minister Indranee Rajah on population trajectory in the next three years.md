**FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE**  
**WRITTEN REPLY**  
**MONDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 2022**

 **Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:**

To ask the Prime Minister what is the projected rate of population growth in Singapore broken down by (i) citizens (ii) permanent residents and (iii) non-residents over the next three years.

**Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):**

Singapore’s population size is influenced by several factors. Our resident population (comprising Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs)) is affected by marriage and fertility rates, mortality trends, and migration levels. The non-resident population is dependent on economic cycles and manpower requirements of our businesses, as well as the needs of Singaporean households for domestic help and caregiving.

The global economic outlook over the next three years remains uncertain and the effects of COVID-19 on population trends may persist for some time. While our population trajectory in the near term may experience some fluctuations, the pace of population growth in this decade is likely to remain slower than that in the previous decade, in line with trends before the pandemic hit. We expect our total population to remain significantly below 6.9 million by 2030.

We will continue to monitor our population trends closely to ensure that our policies and plans meet Singaporeans’ needs.
