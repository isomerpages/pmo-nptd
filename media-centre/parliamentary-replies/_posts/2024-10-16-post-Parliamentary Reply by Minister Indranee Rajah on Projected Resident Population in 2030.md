<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 16 OCTOBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) in view that Singapore’s
total population is now expected to be significantly below the 6.9 million
projected in the 2013 Population White Paper, how does the Government reconcile
the 2013 projection with the current outlook; and (b) what is the revised
projected resident population, consisting of Singapore citizens and permanent
residents, for 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The 2013 Population White Paper had stated that Singapore’s total population
could range between 6.5 and 6.9 million by 2030. However, the Paper also
stated that there is a wider band of uncertainty and that the actual population
would depend on factors such as fertility and life expectancy trends, the
global and regional environment, our economic structure and social needs.
The current figure of 6.04 million as of June 2024 is congruous with the
qualifications in the White Paper.</p>
<p>Our resident population, consisting of Singapore Citizens and Permanent
Residents, could range from 4.3 to 4.4 million by 2030 but again, the actual
figures will depend on various factors such as actual fertility rates and
immigration trends.</p>
<p>We update our population projections based on the latest assessment of
relevant factors, to develop a range of possible outcomes, instead of planning
based on a single number.</p>
