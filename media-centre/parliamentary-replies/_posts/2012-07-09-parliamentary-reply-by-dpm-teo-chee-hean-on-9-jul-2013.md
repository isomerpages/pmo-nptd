WRITTEN ANSWER  
MONDAY, 9 JULY 2012**                  

#### BREAKDOWN OF NUMBER OF SINGAPOREAN CITIZENS, PRS AND NON-RESIDENTS ACCORDING TO AGE GROUPS

**Mr Laurence Lien:**   
To ask the Prime Minister what are the latest numbers of Singapore citizens, permanent residents, and non-residents, broken down in five-year age bands for those aged between 20 and 64 years old.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  
Our resident population (i.e. citizens and permanent residents) was 3.79 million as of June 2011. Those aged 20-64 years made up 67% of the resident population. The composition of the resident population aged 20-64 years is shown in Table 1.

As at June 2011, we also had a non-resident population of 1.39 million who are living in Singapore on a non-permanent basis. These include our work pass holders, international students, as well as dependants of our employment pass holders, permanent residents or citizens. 89% (1.24 million) of the non-resident population were aged 20-64 years. The non-resident population is transient and its composition changes according to our needs.
