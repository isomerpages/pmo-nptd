<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 14 OCTOBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry
will consider (i) reviewing the Extended Childcare Leave (ECL) scheme to
increase the number of leave days reimbursed by the Government and (ii)
introducing a Paid Caregiving Leave scheme similar to the Government-paid
Childcare Leave scheme, for caregivers of elderly parents and other family
dependents.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government provides a wide range of support for parents and caregivers
to manage both caregiving and work responsibilities.</p>
<p>We have been progressively enhancing parental leave provisions to support
working parents in managing their work and caregiving responsibilities,
including recent enhancements to Government-Paid Paternity Leave and the
introduction of the new Shared Parental Leave (SPL) scheme. We recognise
that parents continue to require time-off from work to care for their children
beyond the early years and will study how to better support them to do
so, as part of our regular review of policies.</p>
<p>Apart from childcare, we also recognise that employees may have other
caregiving needs such as care for elderly parents and other family dependents.
Even without any legislated requirement, many progressive employers have
stepped up to introduce caregiving-related leave provisions, as part of
their strategy to attract and retain good workers.</p>
<p>In considering further enhancements to legislated leave provisions, we
will need to strike a balance between the caregiving needs of employees
and the business costs and manpower needs of employers. We also need to
provide employers with some time to adjust to the new SPL scheme which
took effect in April this year and will only be fully implemented from
April next year.</p>
<p>Beyond leave provisions, working caregivers have highlighted that flexible
work arrangements (FWAs) have been useful in helping them manage work and
caregiving responsibilities. The Tripartite Guidelines on FWA Requests
were therefore implemented in December 2024 to set norms and expectations
on how employees should request for FWAs and use them responsibly, as well
as how employers should consider and respond to such requests properly.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to assess the current leave provisions. The
Government remains committed to supporting the needs of working caregivers
and will continue to work with the tripartite partners to foster more family-friendly
workplaces.</p>
<p></p>
