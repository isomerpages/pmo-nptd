<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 26 FEBRUARY 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry
will consider reimbursing the Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) based
on the average of a person’s gross monthly salary over the past few months
before the commencement of the leave; and (b) if not, whether the Ministry
will consider including certain incentive payments and allowances, which
are currently excluded, into the reimbursement calculation of the GPPL.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government-paid parental leave is meant to support working parents
who need to take time away from work to care for their children, by ensuring
that they receive income during the period of parental leave. An eligible
working father who is entitled to Government-Paid Paternity Leave is paid
at his gross rate of pay for every day of leave that is taken, capped at
$2,500 per week. The gross rate of pay is the salary that employees typically
receive when they are away from work on public holidays, or on other forms
of paid leave such as annual leave. Hence, it does not include variable
components that are accrued due to work such as overtime pay, incentive
payments meant to recognise increased productivity at work, or travelling,
food and housing allowances that are meant to cover specific expenses associated
with work done. For this reason, there is no need to compute the working
parent’s gross monthly salary based on his compensation over the preceding
months before the commencement of parental leave.</p>
