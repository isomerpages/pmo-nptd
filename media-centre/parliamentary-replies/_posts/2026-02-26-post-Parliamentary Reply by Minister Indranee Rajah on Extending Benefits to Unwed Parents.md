<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY, 26 FEBRUARY 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Kenneth Tiong Boon Kiat</strong>:</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how many children
of unwed mothers were excluded from Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Working Mother's
Child Relief in each of the past five years; (b) what would extending both
benefits to these children cost annually; and (c) whether the Ministry
has compared this cost against downstream expenditure on alternative support
pathways including ComCare, ComLink+, KidSTART, and public housing for
these families.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>:</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2024, there were on average, about 745 non-marital live births
per year to Singapore citizen mothers in Singapore.</p>
<p>The Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Working Mother’s Child Relief were designed
to encourage parenthood within marriage. Hence, they were not extended
to single unwed parents. It is not an issue of cost. Therefore, we do not
track how much it would have cost to extend these benefits to unwed parents,
nor do we compare this against expenditure on other programmes that may
support these families.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, single unwed parents are eligible for Government benefits
that support the growth and development of their children. These include
leave provisions, as well as subsidies for infant care, childcare, education
and healthcare. They are also eligible for the Migrant Domestic Worker
Levy Concession, and the Child Development Account (CDA) benefits, which
include the CDA First Step Grant and Government Co-matching.</p>
<p>Single unwed parents who require additional support can apply for financial
assistance via the SupportGoWhere portal, and approach family service centres
for holistic support which may include help through programmes like ComCare
and KidSTART.</p>
