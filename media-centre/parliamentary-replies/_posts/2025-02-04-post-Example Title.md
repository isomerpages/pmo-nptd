<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry
will consider implementing the enhanced provisions for Government-paid
paternity leave with immediate effect to encourage familial bonding for
parents with infants born over the last few months of 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether arrangements
can be made to implement the new shared parental leave scheme earlier,
for parents of children born after the National Day Rally 2024 but before
1 April 2025, in situations where (i) both parents and their respective
employers are all mutually agreeable to proceed or (ii) both parents are
serving in the public service; and (b) if not possible, why not and what
are the reasons and/or technical hurdles.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The additional two weeks of Government Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) have
been provided on a voluntary basis since 1 January 2024. Fathers whose
employers are ready to grant the additional two weeks of leave can already
take four weeks of GPPL, and their employers will be reimbursed by the
Government.</p>
<p>The implementation date of 1 April 2025 for mandating the additional two
weeks of GPPL and introducing the new Shared Parental Leave (SPL) scheme
was set after extensive consultation with the Tripartite Partners. It takes
into account the need for system and process changes by both the Government
and employers, and also strikes a balance between giving employers sufficient
time to make the necessary adjustments, and allowing parents to benefit
from both leave enhancements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unlike other parental leave provisions, the sharing of leave entitlements
is a key feature of the new SPL scheme whereby couples can decide how to
allocate the leave entitlement between them based on their caregiving and
work arrangements. As such, its implementation is less straightforward,
and employers will need to update their administrative processes and HR
systems to prepare for this. A common start date is therefore preferable
for parity across all employers, to ensure that all employers, including
smaller firms, will be ready to implement the changes on 1 April 2025.</p>
<p>The Government is also developing a centralised system to facilitate the
coordination of leave sharing arrangements between parents and employers.
Such a system is necessary to ensure the proper tracking of leave records
to minimise discrepancies, and facilitate reimbursement claims from the
Government.</p>
