<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY, 27 FEBRUARY 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr David Hoe</strong>:</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government
will consider having commuting support measures to encourage marriage and
parenthood, such as stronger cost offsets including targeted or time-limited
private transport rebates or equivalent transport credits for families
with young children, particularly for lower- and middle-income households.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:</p>
<p>The Government provides a suite of financial support measures to help
families with young children manage the costs of child-raising. We are
aware of the cost of transport for families with young children, and have
factored this into the design of our financial support schemes, which include
cash and cash-like payouts that can be used to offset the cost of transport
services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For example, all families received $500 in Child LifeSG Credits
(CLC) for&nbsp;each Singaporean child aged 12 and below last year, and
will receive another round of CLC this year. Under the Large Families Scheme,
eligible families with three or more children also receive up to $6,000
in Large Family LifeSG Credits (LFLC) for each third and&nbsp;subsequent&nbsp;child.
The CLC and LFLC can be used to defray the cost of taxi and private hire
transport services. The Large Families Scheme also provides families with
three or more children with special privileges at partner merchants, such
as deals when booking car-sharing services.</p>
<p>We will continue to review our policies to strengthen support for families.</p>
