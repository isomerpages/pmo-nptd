<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 15 OCTOBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what is the reason
for the higher number of new citizenships and permanent residencies granted
last year as compared to the average over the last five years; and (b)
whether this increase is indicative of a sustained upward trend in new
citizenships and permanent residencies granted.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>We take in a carefully controlled number of new Permanent Residents (PRs)
and citizens each year. The exact number of new PRs and citizenships granted
each year depends on several factors, including the number and quality
of applications we receive, and our changing needs.</p>
<p>For example, in recent years, we have granted PRs to healthcare workers
to support our growing healthcare needs. &nbsp;We also granted a higher
number of citizenships in line with the stronger applicant pool, based
on factors such as assimilability, contributions, and links to Singapore
such as having Singaporean family members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our immigration policy is also reviewed regularly to account for changes
to demographic trends. For instance, if our TFR declines further or other
demographic trends shift significantly â€“ we will have to review and adjust
our intake accordingly.</p>
<p>Regardless, we will continue to maintain a measured pace of immigration
and be careful to grant PR or citizenship to those who can contribute,
integrate well, and are committed to sinking their roots here, so that
Singapore remains a cohesive society and a good home for all Singaporeans.</p>
