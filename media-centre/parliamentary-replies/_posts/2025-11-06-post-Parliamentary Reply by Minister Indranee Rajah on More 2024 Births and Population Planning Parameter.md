<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what are the factors
that have contributed to the higher number of babies born in 2024; and
(b) whether Singapore’s long-term population parameter that is used for
infrastructure planning will remain at 6.9 million given that the population
has crossed 6 million for the first time in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>There were 29,237 citizen births in 2024, a 1.2% increase from the 28,877
citizen births in 2023.</p>
<p>The overall increase in citizen births was primarily due to an increase
in Chinese births between 2023 and 2024. The increase in Chinese births
was due in part to the effect of the Dragon Year in 2024. However, the
Dragon Year effect has diminished over time, reflecting a shift away from
traditional beliefs among younger generations in their childbearing decisions.</p>
<p>Our total population was 6.11 million as of June 2025. Based on current
trends and the various scenarios we use to plan for the long term, our
total population is expected to remain significantly below 6.9 million
by 2030, and this figure continues to remain relevant as a planning parameter
for the 2030s.</p>
