<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 4 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr David Hoe:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry
will consider expanding permissible uses of Child Development Account (CDA)
funds to subsidise enrichment classes or programmes beyond preschools;
and (b) whether the Ministry will consider applying means-testing to future
CDA fund top-ups to uplift lower-income households more equitably.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>From May this year, we already expanded the scope of CDA use to cover
all preschool incidental charges stipulated in the Early Childhood Development
Centres (ECDC) Regulations 2018, including optional enrichment programmes
offered in-school. This was to provide more financial support for preschoolers
to fully tap on the learning opportunities offered by their preschools.
This is similar to how students are able to tap on Edusave for enrichment
programmes organised by their schools.</p>
<p>To safeguard the use of CDA funds for preschool fees and incidental charges,
it is not advisable to open up CDA funds for enrichment programmes offered
outside of preschools.</p>
<p>CDA top-ups are a broad-based measure to help families with their cost
of child-raising. Lower-income families may receive further means-tested
subsidies, such as additional preschool subsidies. Lower-income households
who require additional financial support may also approach Social Service
Offices for financial assistance.</p>
