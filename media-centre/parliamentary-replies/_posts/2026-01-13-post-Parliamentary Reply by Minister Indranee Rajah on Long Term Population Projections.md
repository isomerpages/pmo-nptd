<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 13 JANUARY 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Fadli Fawzi:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what is the population
figure used by the Government as an infrastructure planning parameter to
plan for the long term beyond 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Fadli Fawzi:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government
expects Singapore's total population to be at, above, or below 6.9 million
beyond 2030; and (b) what are the justifications for such projections.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our future population size depends on various demographic trends, such
as birth rates, life expectancies, and migration, as well as future social
and economic needs. We thus develop various scenarios which are used for
infrastructure planning to ensure that we are prepared for a range of possible
outcomes, and do not plan on the basis of any single population number.</p>
<p>Our scenarios show that our total population is expected to remain significantly
below 6.9 million by 2030, and that 6.9 million remains relevant as a planning
parameter for the 2030s.</p>
