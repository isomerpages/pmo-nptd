<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MONDAY, 9 SEPTEMBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry
will consider raising the age ceiling for childcare leave provisions until
the child is 12 years of age, considering the wider adoption of home-based
learning in primary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>Today, each working parent is entitled to six days of paid childcare leave
per year, when their youngest Singaporean child is below seven years old.
In addition, each working parent will be entitled to two days of paid Extended
Childcare Leave per year when the youngest child is aged between seven
and 12 years old.</p>
<p>These childcare leave provisions are on top of annual leave entitlements
and are designed as such because older children are generally more independent
compared to younger children. Hence, parents with younger children are
granted more childcare leave provisions. There are no plans at present
to raise the age ceiling for childcare leave.</p>
<p>Primary schools are not required to conduct Home-Based Learning (HBL)
on a regular basis. They may conduct HBL on a few days each year based
on the schools’ needs, and as part of emergency preparedness in case they
need to shift to HBL in contingency situations. Schools will inform parents
in advance so they can make alternative care arrangements if needed. Student
care centres also remain open as per other school days.</p>
<p>In considering any further enhancement to leave provisions, including
increasing childcare leave for parents with older children, we will need
to strike a balance between supporting the needs of parents and the impact
on employers’ manpower and operational requirements.</p>
<p>Therefore, beyond legislated leave provisions, we encourage employers
to put in place other sustainable family-friendly workplace practices,
such as flexible work arrangements (FWAs). The Tripartite Guidelines on
FWA Requests will take effect from 1 December 2024. The mandatory Guidelines
will enable employers and employees to have open discussions and work out
arrangements that can meet both parties’ needs and constraints. We encourage
supervisors and colleagues to be supportive when working parents need to
tap on these measures to care for their children.</p>
