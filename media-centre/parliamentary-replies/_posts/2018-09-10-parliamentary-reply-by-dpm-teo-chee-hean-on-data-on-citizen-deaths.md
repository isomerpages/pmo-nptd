**THIRTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
WRITTEN ANSWER  
MONDAY 10 SEP 2018**    

**Mr Leon Perera:**

To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether the Ministry can release data for Singapore citizens deaths over the last 10 years (as distinct from resident deaths); and (b) at what year in the future will citizen deaths exceed citizen births according to existing demographic forecasts.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  

The total number of resident deaths has increased from around 16,200 in 2008 to 19,800 in 2017. The total number of citizen deaths has increased from around 15,600 in 2008 to 19,100 in 2017.

Based on current trends<sup>[1]</sup>, the number of citizen deaths could exceed the projected number of citizen births around the mid-2030s.
