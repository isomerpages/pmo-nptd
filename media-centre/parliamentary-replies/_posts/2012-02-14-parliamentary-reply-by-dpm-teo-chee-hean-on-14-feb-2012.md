**WRITTEN ANSWER**  
**TUESDAY, 14 FEBRUARY 2012**    

**Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar:**  
To ask the Prime Minister whether the Ministry grants permanent residence more easily to the foreign spouses of Singaporeans especially those who have children who are Singaporeans.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  
Permanent Residency (PR) is not automatically granted to foreigners who are married to Singapore Citizens (SC).

However, if such a married couple has children who are Singapore Citizens, this is taken into consideration when the application for PR for the non-citizen spouse is assessed.  
Various factors are considered in deciding the grant of PR to foreign spouses, including the duration of marriage and length of stay in Singapore.

Citizens who sponsor their foreign spouses for PR status will also have to show that they are able to support them financially.

Foreign spouses who do not qualify for PR status may be granted a Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) for them to remain in Singapore.

LTVP holders are allowed to seek employment here.

My Ministry is currently studying how we can further help Singaporean families with foreign spouses, especially those with SC children.
