<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 7 MAY 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister (in each year since 2020 (a) how many (i) Singapore
Citizens and (ii) Permanent Residents (PR) who have a registered foreign
address or been overseas for at least 12 months continuously were not included
as part of citizen and PR population in the Population in Brief publication
by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD); (b) whether NPTD
will consider publishing this figure in future editions of Population in
Brief; and (c) if not, why.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with international recommendations, we base our population estimates
on the “de jure” population concept, or place of “usual residence”. Our
methodology for reporting Singapore Citizen (SC) and Permanent Resident
(PR) data therefore excludes those who have only a registered foreign address,
or SCs and PRs who have been overseas continuously for 12 months or more.
This is explained in the Population In Brief publication.</p>
<p>This group of SCs and PRs includes overseas students, professionals working
abroad, and those who are residing overseas for family reasons. Over the
past decade, these SCs and PRs have made up between 2-3% and 8-9% of the
overall SC and PR populations respectively. This is with the exception
of the COVID period when travel restrictions resulted in more SCs and PRs
staying abroad for 12 months or more.</p>
<p>The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) will continue to regularly
review the annual Population in Brief publication, taking into account
international best practices.</p>
