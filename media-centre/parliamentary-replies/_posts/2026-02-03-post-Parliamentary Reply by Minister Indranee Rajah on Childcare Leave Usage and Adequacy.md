<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
<br><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>
<br><strong>TUESDAY, 3 FEBRUARY 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Valerie Lee:</strong>
<br>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry
has conducted studies on the number of leave days taken by parents with
children under seven due to childcare centre closures or their children
falling ill; and (b) if so, whether such leave usage frequently exceeds
the current enhanced childcare leave entitlement.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:
<br>A working parent with a Singaporean child under the age of seven has six
days of Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL) a year. This means that
a working couple has a total of 12 days of GPCL to care for their child,
on top of their annual leave provisions. The Government does not track
the reasons for which parents take GPCL, and we do not have data on whether
the leave usage of parents due to childcare centre closures or their children
falling ill exceeds the current GPCL entitlements.
<br>
<br>As employers only claim reimbursement for those who take more than three
days of GPCL, we only have data for this group of parents. In 2023, the
proportion of eligible working mothers and fathers who took more than three
days of GPCL﻿ was 58% and 53% respectively. Of this group, the vast majority
of mothers and fathers took all six days of GPCL each. Data for 2024 is
not yet available.
<br>
<br>Beyond parental leave provisions, the Government has also introduced the
Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests which parents
can tap on to manage their work and child caregiving responsibilities.
We will continue to review our parental leave provisions and work with
Tripartite Partners to foster more family-friendly workplaces.</p>
