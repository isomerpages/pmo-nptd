<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Cai Yinzhou</strong>:</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether an assessment
has been conducted on the impact of the Baby Bonus and parental leave enhancements
which were implemented in 2023 and 2025, respectively, on the fertility
rate.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>:</p>
<p>It is difficult to discern the impact of any single policy on our fertility
rate as the measures in our Marriage and Parenthood (M&amp;P) package are
intended to work in combination to support Singaporeans in their M&amp;P
journey.</p>
<p>From our surveys and engagements, we have found that the Baby Bonus Scheme
and parental leave enhancements have been positively received. For example,
parents and young couples shared that the parental leave enhancements would
encourage more people to have children. Parents also perceived the increased
financial support and time spent with their newborns to be helpful in their
parenthood journey.</p>
<p>We regularly monitor the efficacy of our measures and will continue to
review our M&amp;P package to better support parents in starting and raising
families.</p>
