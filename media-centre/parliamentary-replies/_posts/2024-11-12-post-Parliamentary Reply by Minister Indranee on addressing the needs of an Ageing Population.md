<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 12 NOVEMBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government
has established specific desired targets or metrics for maintaining a sufficient
number of working-age adults in the workforce to support the ageing population;
and (b) what policy measures is the Government considering to balance the
needs of an ageing population without overburdening the future generations
financially and while minimising social costs.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not have targets on the size of the working-age population to support
an ageing population. Instead, we focus on keeping our seniors healthy
and productive for as long as possible, while ensuring that our population
policies are sustainable and able to meet our social and economic needs.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of an ageing population, we have emphasised strategies
to boost healthy and productive longevity. This includes investing in the
skills of our older workers through SkillsFuture to enhance their employability,
working with employers and unions to support age-friendly jobs and workplaces,
and steadily raising retirement and re-employment ages so that those willing
and able to work for longer can do so.</p>
<p>We have also taken steps to manage the expected increase in healthcare
expenditure to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. These include placing
greater emphasis on population health, implementing value-based care in
healthcare institutions, and encouraging the right-siting of patients to
reduce demand for acute hospital care. We have also rolled out Age Well
SG to help seniors age well in their homes and communities.</p>
<p>By helping seniors stay healthy, and supporting those who wish to work
for longer and save more for retirement to do so, we can age successfully
as a society while managing the burden on younger generations.</p>
