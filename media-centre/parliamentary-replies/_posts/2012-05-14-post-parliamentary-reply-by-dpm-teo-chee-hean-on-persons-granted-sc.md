**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
WRITTEN ANSWER   
MONDAY, 14 MAY 2012**   
       
#### **PERSONS GRANTED SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP  (Breakdown in Figures for PRs and Foreigners)**

**Mrs Lina Chiam:**  
To ask the Prime Minister of the number of persons granted Singapore citizenship annually from 1980 to 2011, what are the annual breakdown figures in terms of (i) permanent residents; and (ii) foreigners.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  
In the past 5 years, there were on average about 18,500 individuals granted Singapore Citizenship (SC) annually. Close to 90% were Permanent Residents (PRs) when they were granted citizenship. The others who were granted SC were children of Singapore citizens born overseas who subsequently registered for Singapore citizenship, as well as minors of successful SC applicants. Under the Constitution, minors do not need to obtain PR status first in order to be eligible for citizenship.
