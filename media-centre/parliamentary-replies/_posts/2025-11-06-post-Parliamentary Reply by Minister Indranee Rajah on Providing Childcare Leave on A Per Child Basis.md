<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr Charlene Chen:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry
will consider reviewing childcare leave provisions so that the entitlement
is calibrated to the number of children under the age of seven, rather
than a flat rate per parent.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The Member is referred to the written reply to Parliamentary Question
No 2 for the Sitting on 14 October 2025:<em>“Enhancements to Extended Childcare Leave Scheme and Proposal of New Leave Scheme for Caregivers”, Official Report, 14 October 2025, Vol 96, Issue No. 7.</em>
</p>
<p>The Government is committed to supporting working parents in caring for
their children and will take the Member’s suggestion into account when
we next review the current leave provisions.</p>
