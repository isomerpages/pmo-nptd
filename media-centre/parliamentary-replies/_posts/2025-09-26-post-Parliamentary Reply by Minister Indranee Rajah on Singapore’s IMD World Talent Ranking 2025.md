<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ORAL REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what is the Government’s
response to Singapore’s recent drop in ranking in the International Institute
for Management Development’s World Talent Ranking 2025, which assesses
the three pillars of investment and development, appeal and readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The International Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Talent
Ranking measures how economies perform in (a) developing home-grown talent,
(b) attracting and retaining overseas talent, and (c) building the skills
and competencies of their labour force. It provides a perspective of how
Singapore is perceived vis-à-vis the other economies as a global talent
hub.</p>
<p>One key driver behind the change in Singapore’s ranking in 2025 was in
perception-based factors, or indicators, in particular how business executives
viewed adequacy of apprenticeships, their perceptions of companies’ prioritisation
of employee training and their confidence in Singapore’s ability to avoid
brain drain. We will analyse these findings as well as other relevant data
carefully, to better understand the underlying causes and see where and
how we can do better.</p>
<p>Singapore’s performance should also be seen in context. For example, demographic
realities limit how much we can grow our workforce. As such, our slowing
labour force growth in 2024 resulted in a fall in the related indicator.
On the other hand, although we were ranked 63rd in terms of our public
expenditure on education as a share of GDP, we were 2nd in the same survey
on education outcomes (i.e., the PISA score). This is a testament to our
cost-effective public spending on education<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Singapore will continue to welcome talent who complement our own capabilities.
We will at the same time press on with our priority in developing our local
workforce. By investing in our people, enhancing our business environment,
strengthening our connectivity and fostering a vibrant tech and innovation
ecosystem, we are confident that Singapore will remain a leading global
talent hub.</p>
