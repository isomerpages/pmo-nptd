<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MONDAY, 9 SEPTEMBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry
can release the data on deaths of Singapore citizens over the last ten
years, as distinct from resident deaths; and (b) what is the projected
year in which citizen deaths will exceed citizen births based on current
trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The total number of resident deaths has increased from 18,200 in 2014
to 25,600 in 2023. The total number of citizen deaths has increased from
17,700 in 2014 to 24,700 in 2023.</p>
<p>Based on current trends<sup>1</sup>, the number of citizen deaths could
exceed the number of citizen births in the first half of the 2030s.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>The projections are meant to illustrate the growth and change
in population that could occur if certain demographic assumptions prevail
over the projection period. These assumptions may or may not be realised.</p>
