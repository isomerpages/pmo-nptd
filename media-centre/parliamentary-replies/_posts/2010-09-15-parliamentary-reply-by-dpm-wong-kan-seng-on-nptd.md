#### **PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS:**

**Assoc Prof Paulin Tay Straughan:**
To ask the Prime Minister what is the primary function of the Population and Talent Division and how will it complement the roles of the National Population Committee and the National Integration Council.

Mr Teo Siong Seng: To ask the Prime Minister (a) when will the Population and Talent Division be setup; and (b) what kind of programmes will be put in place to manage the impact of Singapore's immigration policy.

**Mr Wong Kan Seng (for the Prime Minister):**
The key function of the Population and Talent Division (PTD) is to formulate, coordinate and review whole of government policies related to population and talent. PTD’s responsibilities will encompass three main policy areas that are currently under the purview of the National Population Secretariat, the National Integration Council and other Ministries, such as the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. These are: One, population augmentation; two, talent attraction, immigration, naturalisation and integration; and three, engaging overseas Singaporeans. These policy issues have close linkages with each another. PTD’s formation will bring them together under one management and centre of responsibility, and enable policy responses to be considered and addressed more holistically.

The National Population Secretariat is now working towards the inauguration of PTD at the beginning of next year, as time is needed to work with the various Ministries on portfolio changes and staff movements. More details will be made available when these are completed.
