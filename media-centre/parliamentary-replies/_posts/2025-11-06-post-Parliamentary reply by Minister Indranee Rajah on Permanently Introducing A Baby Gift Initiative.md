<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ORAL REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Valerie Lee:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry
will consider permanently introducing a baby gift, similar to Singapore’s
SG60 Baby Gift and Finland’s Baby Box Scheme, to support new parents with
parenting essentials.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The SG60 Baby Gift is an initiative to commemorate Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> year
of independence. There are currently no plans to introduce such gifts on
a permanent basis as the purpose of these gifts is to mark special milestones
in our nation’s journey. However, we will continue to review how we can
celebrate and support families.</p>
<p>We have enhanced and introduced new measures in the Marriage and Parenthood
package over the years to provide greater financial support for parents.
&nbsp;For instance, parents have flexibility in using the Baby Bonus Cash
Gift, which ranges from $11,000 for the first and second child, to $13,000
for the third and subsequent children, to purchase baby essentials. We
have also introduced the Large Families Scheme, under which parents with
three or more children will receive $1,000 of Large Family LifeSG Credits
each year for every third and subsequent Singapore Citizen child, from
the year that the child turns one to the year that the child turns six.</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to promoting marriage and parenthood,
and we will continue to review our policies to ensure they remain relevant
in supporting parents.</p>
