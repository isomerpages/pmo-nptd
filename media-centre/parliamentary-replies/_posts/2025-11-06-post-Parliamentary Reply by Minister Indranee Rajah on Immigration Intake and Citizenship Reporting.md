<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what demographic

the intended intake of new Permanent Residents (PRs) and citizens; (b)
whether the change in reporting Chart 17 in Population in Brief 2025 reflects
a change in the intake determination methodology; and (c) if so, what is
the expected impact on future intake determinations.</p>
