<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what demographic
statistics other than the total fertility rate are being used to determine
the intended intake of new Permanent Residents (PRs) and citizens; (b)
whether the change in reporting Chart 17 in Population in Brief 2025 reflects
a change in the intake determination methodology; and (c) if so, what is
the expected impact on future intake determinations.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>Our intake of Permanent Residents and citizens takes into account several
factors. Apart from our total fertility rate, we also consider other demographic
indicators such as life expectancy and age profile of our population. Our
intake also varies on an annual basis depending on the number and quality
of applications we receive.</p>
<p>Starting from the publication of the Population in Brief 2025, we have
excluded citizenships granted by descent from being reported as part of
the total number of citizenships granted. This is to more accurately reflect
immigration inflows, since citizenship by descent is a constitutional entitlement
for children born overseas to at least one Singaporean parent. It is akin
to how children born in Singapore to Singaporean parents are constitutionally
entitled to citizenship by birth. The number of citizenships by descent
granted will continue to be reported under the Marriage and Parenthood
section of the Population in Brief, and is also available on other open
sources such as the Department of Statistics’ SingStat Table Builder.</p>
<p>This is a technical change in reporting and our intake methodology has
not changed.</p>
