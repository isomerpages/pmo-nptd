**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT  
WRITTEN ANSWER  
MONDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2013**

**Mr Zaqy Mohamad:**   
To ask the Prime Minister (a) currently, how many enforcement officers are deployed by Government agencies including those outsourced through service providers to deter littering, traffic offences and illegal parking; (b) what proportion of these public enforcement officers are made up of foreigners; and (c) whether he will consider making it a policy to have all public enforcement officers either Singapore citizens or Permanent Residents.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  
As at 31 December 2012, there were about 20,000 enforcement officers deployed by various public sector agencies, including those in areas outsourced to the private sector.

Enforcement work includes maintaining law and order, policing our borders, conducting site inspections and issuing parking fines, among others.

Currently 2% of our enforcement officers are foreigners and they are largely deployed to deter littering and illegal parking.

Effective enforcement work ensures that Singapore’s laws and rules are observed for the safety and well-being of Singaporeans.

It is important that our enforcement officers have a good understanding of the laws and rules in Singapore so as to discharge their responsibilities competently and effectively.

The affected agencies will review the suitability of foreigners in enforcement functions and consider the suggestion of Mr Zaqy Mohammed.
