<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 3 FEBRUARY 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Elysa Chen:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in respect of the key
drivers affecting women’s decisions to delay childbirth, whether the Ministry
will consider refreshed practical support measures such as structural help
with daily tasks and labour and postpartum guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah:</strong>
</p>
<p>There are various reasons why women may decide to delay childbirth. These
include prioritisation of other life goals like career, and concerns about
whether they can manage the changes that come with parenthood.</p>
<p>The Government provides a comprehensive Marriage &amp; Parenthood (M&amp;P)
package with support measures across areas like housing, healthcare, parental
leave and child caregiving, to help couples to start and raise families.
Support measures are regularly reviewed to address the needs of parents.
For instance, from 1 April this year, parents will have 10 weeks of Shared
Parental Leave (SPL) on top of maternity and paternity leave to give them
more time to bond with their newborns and adapt to the new routines of
parenting.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and labour, and the period after childbirth can be challenging
to navigate especially for first-time parents. We have been strengthening
support for them. For example, polyclinics now provide mothers with practical
support in areas such as antenatal education and post-natal recovery. Family
Nexus sites also provide guidance on parenting programmes.</p>
<p>Parents can also visit the Families for Life Parenting Portal or Parent
Hub to access a wide range of resources on topics ranging from pregnancy
to child health, to parenting tips.</p>
<p>We will continue to look into ways to strengthen support for parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
