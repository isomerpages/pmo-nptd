<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong> 
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong> 
</p>
<p><strong>MONDAY, 5 FEBRUARY 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr Wan Rizal:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister (a) what are the strategies being adopted to
encourage firms to implement the additional two weeks of paternity leave
that are given on a voluntary basis by employers; and (b) how does the
Government plan to monitor and ensure compliance with this policy once
it becomes mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong> 
</p>
<p>Paternal involvement in child raising at an early stage is increasingly
being recognised as important for the well-being of the child and the family.
To encourage shared parental responsibility and have fathers be more involved
in child-raising, the Government has doubled the Government-Paid Paternity
Leave (GPPL) from two weeks to four weeks since 1 January 2024. The additional
two weeks are currently provided on a voluntary basis. This is to give
employers some time to adjust, taking into consideration the economic conditions,
operational and manpower challenges faced by some employers. Employers
who are ready to, and voluntarily grant the additional two weeks of leave
will be reimbursed by the Government, just as they are for the mandatory
first two weeks.</p>
<p>As signalled by DPM Wong last year, we aim to make the additional two
weeks of GPPL mandatory as soon as possible. We encourage employers who
have not yet done so to make the most of this voluntary period to start
adjusting their HR practices to accommodate the additional two weeks of
paternity leave so that they will be ready and can transition seamlessly
once it is made mandatory.</p>
<p>As with other legislated parental leave provisions, failure to grant mandatory
paternity leave to an employee who is entitled to and has requested such
leave is an offence, and subjected to the penalties as laid out in the
Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA). Employees who encounter disputes
with their employers relating to their GPPL entitlements can lodge a claim
at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management.</p>
<p>We are working with employers to encourage them to implement family-friendly
workplace practices, including supporting fathers to take paternity leave.
For example, in June last year, we worked with Association of Small and
Medium Enterprises (ASME) to discuss how employers can be family-friendly
while staying competitive and productive.</p>
<p>We will continue to work closely with Tripartite Partners and community
partners such as Families for Life Council and Centre for Fathering (CFF)
to encourage employers to foster a progressive and supportive workplace
culture for fathers. The CFF engages companies to promote the importance
of supporting fathers in managing work and family, and greater paternal
involvement in child-raising. CFFâ€™s Great Companies for Dads Award also
recognises companies that have put in place family-friendly policies and
initiatives and can inspire others to do so too.</p>
