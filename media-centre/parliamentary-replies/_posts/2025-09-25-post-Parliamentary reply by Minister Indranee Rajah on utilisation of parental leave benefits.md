<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY, 25 SEPTEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Cassandra Lee:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in light of the Family
Trends Report 2025 (a) whether the Ministry is studying the reasons why
parental leave benefits (both paternal and maternal) remain significantly
underutilised; (b) if so, what are the top three reasons for the underutilisation;
and (c) how does the Ministry intend to address these reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:</p>
<p>The Family Trends Report 2025 shows that the take-up rates of Government-Paid
Maternity Leave (GPML) between 2016 and 2023 remain high, ranging between
74% and 79%. More than half of fathers took Government-Paid Paternity Leave
(GPPL), with the proportion increasing from 47% in 2016 to 56% in 2023.</p>
<p>The take-up rate of childcare leave by mothers has remained stable from
56% in 2016 to 58% in 2023. The take-up rate of childcare leave by fathers
has increased slightly from 49% in 2016 to 53% in 2023.</p>
<p>The take-up rate for the new Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is not available
yet as this has only just been implemented in April this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several reasons why some parents may not make use of their full
parental leave entitlements. From our research and engagements with parents,
actual utilisation varies according to the nature of the job, workplace
norms and attitudes, and societal perceptions of gender roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give parents assurance in utilising their parental leave provisions,
the Government made the additional two weeks of GPPL and 10 weeks of new
SPL mandatory. The Government also extended employment protections against
unlawful dismissal of employees taking GPPL and adoption leave.</p>
<p>In addition, when the Workplace Fairness Act comes into force, employees
will be protected from being discriminated against (including being dismissed)
on the grounds of protected characteristics such as pregnancy and caregiving
responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, legislative provisions can only go so far. What is needed is
a whole-of-society approach which is supportive of families, and parental
and caregiving responsibilities. For businesses, this means investing in
good HR practices which allow companies to strike the right balance between
business efficiency and productivity, and support for employees who are
parents. At the same time, we cultivate a collaborative approach between
employers and employees. For example, by extending the minimum four-week
notice period beyond GPML to GPPL, adoption leave and the new SPL, we encourage
employees to discuss their leave plans early with their employers to facilitate
covering arrangements.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to work with Tripartite Partners to build
a supportive workplace culture for families.</p>
