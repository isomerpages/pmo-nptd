**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
(FIRST SESSION)  
QUESTIONS FOR WRITTEN ANSWER  
MONDAY, 16 JANUARY 2012**

#### **CITIZENSHIP AND PERMANENT RESIDENCE APPLICATIONS (Profile of Applicants)**

**Mr Yaw Shin Leong:**  
To ask the Prime Minister from 2005 to 2010 what is the breakdown by age, detailed education profile, number of years of residency, and income level for the number of (i) citizenships that are granted each year; and (ii) permanent residence applications that are approved for EP/S pass holders in each year.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  
Following the tightening of our immigration criteria in late 2009, the number of new Permanent Residence (PR) applications granted declined from 59,460 in 2009 to 29,265 in 2010, while the number of citizenship applications granted declined from 19,928 in 2009 to 18,758 in 2010. PR applications from Employment Pass/S pass holders are typically assessed under the Professionals, Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers Scheme (PTS). The number of new PTS PR applications granted correspondingly declined from 27,042 in 2009 to 11,161 in 2010.

Each PR and SC application is evaluated holistically on a set of criteria which includes factors such as the individual’s economic contributions, qualifications, age and family profile to assess applicants’ ability to contribute, integrate well into society and commitment to sinking roots.

a. The profile of applicants granted citizenship or PTS PR from 2005 to 2010 is as follows:  
Age. The majority of new Singapore citizens (SCs) and PTS PRs are working individuals and their dependants. More than half of new SCs and PTS PRs granted were aged 30 years and below (on average 55% and 56% respectively). 

b. Number of Years of Residency. The majority (85%) of PTS PRs were granted PR within 5 years after their first long-term pass1 was issued, while the majority (73%) of SCs naturalised within 10 years after the issue of their first long-term pass
Highest Education Qualification. The majority (83%) of new PTS PRs held diploma/degree-level qualifications or higher. The education profile of new SCs is more diverse, with 36% of new SCs holding diploma/degree-level qualifications or higher, as it includes new SCs granted on account of family ties. Children sponsored by their parents comprise a significant proportion of this group.  

c. Income. Applicants earning more than $4,000 a month (i.e. the qualifying salary for a P2 Employment Pass prior to 1 January 2012), comprised 23% of PTS PRs and 28% of economically active new SCs granted from 2005 to 2010. The income profile of new SCs and PTS PRs has since improved following the tightening of our immigration criteria in late 2009. Those earning more than $4,000 a month constituted 43% of PTS PRs and 45% of economically active new SCs granted in 2010.
