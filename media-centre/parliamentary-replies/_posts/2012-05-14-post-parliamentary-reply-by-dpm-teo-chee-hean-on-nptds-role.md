**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
ORAL ANSWER  
MONDAY, 14 MAY 2012**
        
**Mr Teo Siong Seng:**   
To ask the Prime Minister (a) what are the specific roles and objectives of the National Population and Talent Division in the light of Singapore's current efforts to restructure the economy; (b) what measures are being taken to identify, attract, retain and develop both local and foreign talents to sustain our social, cultural and economic development; and (c) what has been achieved thus far.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean:**  
The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) works closely with economic, social and infrastructure agencies to coordinate policies to achieve a sustainable population – one which ensures a good quality of life, with an inclusive and cohesive society and a vibrant economy that supports good jobs for Singaporeans now and in the future.

Economic restructuring is a long-term collective effort by businesses, workers and the government to upgrade the economy, reduce our reliance on foreign workers, and raise productivity so that Singaporean wages continue to rise and job opportunities improve.

We are building a strong core of Singaporeans to contribute to a vibrant economy and take up key roles in our industries.

New education institutions in the arts, design and technology give Singaporeans greater opportunities to develop their diverse abilities and pursue exciting careers.   
We are also helping Singaporeans to upgrade through continuing education and skills training programmes.

Singaporeans working or studying overseas are kept engaged by the Overseas Singaporean Unit in NPTD to keep them updated on developments and opportunities here.

NPTD also monitors and analyses trends in migration and the labour landscape in Singapore and globally.

By creating a conducive environment to live, work and play in, Singapore will continue to be an attractive place for Singaporeans, as well as those who are able to contribute to Singapore’s development.

Our objective is to develop a sustainable population as we face the challenges of an ageing and shrinking citizen population and workforce. NPTD will engage the public on these important issues as we prepare the White Paper on Population to be tabled by the end of the year.
