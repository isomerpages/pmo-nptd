<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 2 APRIL 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister (a) how many companies have provided the extra
two weeks of Government-Paid Paternity Leave announced in Budget 2023;
and (b) if this data is not available, whether the Ministry will consider
collecting this information.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The additional two weeks of Government-Paid Paternity Leave currently
provided on a voluntary basis came into effect on 1 January 2024. Fathers
have up to one year after their childâ€™s birth to use the leave, and employers
have three months after that to submit their claims. As such, the data
requested is currently unavailable. We are monitoring the utilisation of
the voluntary leave provision and will collate the data when available.</p>
