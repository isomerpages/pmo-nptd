<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, 5 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government
has a projected optimum population density for Singapore that takes into
consideration spatial comfort and feelings of crowdedness; and (b) if not,
why not.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government takes a long-term approach towards land use and infrastructure
planning, to ensure that we have sufficient land to meet our current and
future needs and to provide a high-quality living environment for all Singaporeans.
When developing our plans, we consider our changing demographic and socioeconomic
trends, as well as the evolving needs and aspirations of Singaporeans,
and how we can optimally respond to these with the physical space that
we have. We do not plan around a single or optimum population density.</p>
<p>To ensure that our city remains liveable for all, we also incorporate
urban design strategies islandwide, such as varying building heights and
creating well-connected and pedestrian-friendly public spaces.</p>
