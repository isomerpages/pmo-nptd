<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ORAL REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 10 SEPTEMBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Hany Soh:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance with regard to the
new shared parental leave scheme (NSPL) announced on 18 August 2024 (a)
what is the rationale for commencing the NSPL on 1 April 2025; (b) whether
the Government will consider bringing forward the NSPL commencement date
to 2024; and (c) if the commencement date cannot be brought forward, whether
there are alternative support measures available to prospective parents
who will otherwise miss out on the NSPL benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what are the planned
efforts with the Tripartite Partners to drive support for the new shared
parental leave scheme, especially on the utilisation of paternity leave.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>The new Shared Parental Leave (SPL) scheme is a significant enhancement
of our parental leave provisions, providing ten additional weeks of paid
leave that can be shared between both parents to care for their infant.</p>
<p>The implementation date of 1 April 2025 was set after extensive consultation
with the Tripartite Partners. We had considered implementing the new scheme
earlier so that more parents can benefit. However, employers had requested
for a longer lead time to prepare for this change, as companies need to
update their administrative processes, and to put in place new measures
to manage their employees’ extended absences. This is especially so because
the new SPL scheme involves a leave sharing feature which requires coordination
between both parents and their respective employers. Time is also needed
for the Government to effect various legislative and operational changes.</p>
<p>We fully understand that parents who miss out on the enhancements could
feel disappointed. However, the deferred start date is necessary to ensure
that all stakeholders involved are ready to implement the changes. Implementing
the new SPL from 1 April 2025 strikes a balance between giving employers
sufficient time to make the necessary adjustments in this tight labour
market, and allowing parents to benefit from the enhancements as soon as
possible. As such, we are not able to bring forward the implementation
date.</p>
<p>Parents whose babies are born before 1 April 2025 will still be eligible
for comprehensive support under the Marriage and Parenthood package. These
include the recent enhancements to the Baby Bonus Scheme that provides
for higher financial support, as well as the doubling of Government-Paid
Paternity Leave, on a voluntary basis, and Unpaid Infant Care Leave since
1 January 2024 to give parents more time to care for their newborn, or
to settle caregiving arrangements.</p>
<p>During this transition period before the new SPL takes effect, we encourage
employers to update their manpower and business approaches to facilitate
more progressive workplace practices, and to foster a more family-friendly
culture. Employers who can provide more than the current legislated provisions,
whether in the form of leave or other support, are encouraged to do so,
as this can position them as employers of choice.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to work closely with Tripartite Partners
to support the implementation of the enhanced parental leave provisions.
We will organise webinars for employers to understand the operational details
of the scheme, and to provide more information on existing grants and resources
employers can tap on to strengthen their manpower planning capabilities,
and to support their operational and system adjustments.</p>
<p>Our research has shown that utilisation of parental leave is often dependent
on workplace support. We will work with the Tripartite Partners to shape
workplace norms and culture, including to establish the norm of fathers
taking leave to care for and bond with their infants. We will also emphasise
the need for good communication and responsible behaviour on the part of
both employers and employees.</p>
<p>Employees should be mindful of their employers’ operational needs and
act responsibly by informing their employers as early as possible once
they know they are expecting a child. Employers, on their part, should
be facilitative and supportive of employees’ parental leave plans. Employers
and employees should work together to put in place covering arrangements
that best meet the needs and constraints on both sides.</p>
<p>We need to work together as a society to create a culture that embraces
families and children, and supports fathers in playing a greater role in
child-raising while meeting employers’ needs. Together, let’s build a Singapore
Made For Families.</p>
