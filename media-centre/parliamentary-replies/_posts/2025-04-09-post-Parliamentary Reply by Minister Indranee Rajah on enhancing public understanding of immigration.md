<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN REPLY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, 8 APRIL 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant:</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what further policy
initiatives can the Government introduce to enhance public understanding
and support for immigration as a strategic imperative for Singapore’s sustained
economic growth and national security.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>Like many other advanced societies, Singapore faces the demographic challenge
of a low fertility rate and ageing population. The Government is strongly
committed to supporting Singaporeans’ marriage and parenthood aspirations.
Immigration supplements this to keep our citizen population from shrinking
over the longer term.</p>
<p>Most Singaporeans understand Singapore’s overall need for immigrants.
A 2021 Institute of Policy Studies survey found that over 75% of Singaporeans
agreed that immigrants are generally good for Singapore’s economy, and
62% agreed that immigrants improve Singapore society by bringing in new
ideas and culture. However, some may be concerned that immigrants dilute
our national identity or that immigrants do not put in effort to integrate
with locals.</p>
<p>These are valid concerns that we seek to address as follows. First, we
keep the pace of immigration measured and stable, and are careful to grant
Permanent Residency and Singapore Citizenship to those who can contribute
to Singapore, integrate well, and are committed to sinking their roots
here. The majority of the immigrants we take in are of working age and
contribute meaningfully to our economy. Many of them share family ties
with Singaporeans or have studied, worked, or lived in Singapore for some
time. We continually review our immigration framework to ensure it remains
relevant to our social context.</p>
<p>Second, we have programmes to help immigrants to adapt to local norms
and way of life. Our new citizens undergo a mandatory Singapore Citizenship
Journey to improve their understanding of Singapore’s history, norms and
values. The People’s Association has a nationwide network of over 1,500
Integration and Naturalisation Champions to drive integration efforts at
the local level, and foster good relations between new citizens and their
Singaporean neighbours. A National Integration Council (NIC) was also set
up in 2009 to coordinate and encourage integration efforts across the public,
people, and private sectors. The NIC offers resources such as the Unity
in Diversity resource kit and the Community Integration Fund to support
ground-up integration initiatives.</p>
<p>Third, we foster understanding of immigration in our public education
and communication efforts. For example, our students learn about the value
of integration and harmony through National Education in schools, and through
events such as International Friendship Day. Through Lower Secondary History
classes, students grow an appreciation for our forefathers’ contributions
to Singapore’s development as a port city under the British, and how Singapore
continued to remain open to the rest of the world after it became a nation-state
in 1965. In Social Studies classes, students explore the contemporary experiences
of living in a diverse society and how to strengthen cohesion and contribute
towards harmony, while appreciating the economic and cultural contributions
of different groups.</p>
<p>Integration is ultimately a two-way process that takes time and effort.
While immigrants need to make an effort to integrate and adapt to local
ways of life, it is equally important for Singaporeans to be understanding
and welcoming, and support our new neighbours, friends and colleagues in
becoming part of Singapore society.</p>
