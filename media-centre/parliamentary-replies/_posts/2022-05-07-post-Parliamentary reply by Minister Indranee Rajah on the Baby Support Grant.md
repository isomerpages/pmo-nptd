**FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE**  
**ORAL REPLY**  
**MONDAY, 9 MAY 2022**

**Mr Leon Perera:**
 
To ask the Prime Minister (a) to date, whether any exceptions have been made in the disbursement of the Baby Support Grant (BSG), for instance giving the grant to single mothers; and (b) whether the Government is considering an extension of the BSG beyond September 2022 in view of the continuing low total fertility rate at 1.12 in 2021.

**Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister):**

The Baby Support Grant (BSG) was introduced for parents of all Singaporean children born from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2022. Single mothers who were lawfully married to their child's father, but are divorced or widowed, are eligible for the BSG. We also allowed appeals from parents whose babies were born before 1 October 2020, but whose certified Estimated Delivery Date was on or after 1 October 2020. 

The BSG augments existing Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) support measures for families. It was intended to be a one-off measure to signal our support for families during the pandemic and encourage couples to proceed with their parenthood plans. We have received some queries this year on the BSG eligibility period. As the pandemic situation has improved, we have replied that the BSG will not be extended beyond the current eligibility period. 

Parents will continue to benefit from our comprehensive suite of support for M&P, which we have enhanced over the years. For instance, the Government provides parents with up to $18,000 in financial support for their firstborn, through the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, contributions to the Child Development Account (CDA), and Medisave Grant for Newborns. The Government remains committed to supporting Singaporeans who want to get married and have children, and will continue to review our measures to build a Singapore that is Made for Families.
