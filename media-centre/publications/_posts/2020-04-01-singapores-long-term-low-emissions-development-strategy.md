The Singapores Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) document titled “Charting Singapore’s Low-Carbon and Climate Resilient Future”, builds on the enhanced NDC’s target by aspiring to halve our emissions from its peak to 33MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century. To enable Singapore’s low-carbon transition, the LEDS will have three thrusts:

a.	Transformations in industry, economy and society, e.g. more renewable energy, greater energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption;

b.	Adoption of advanced low-carbon technologies, e.g. carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and use of low-carbon fuels; and

c.	Effective international collaboration, e.g. international climate action, regional power grids, market-based mechanisms.
