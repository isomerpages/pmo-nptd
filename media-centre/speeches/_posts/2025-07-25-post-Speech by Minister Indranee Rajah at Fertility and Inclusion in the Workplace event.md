<p>Distinguished business leaders, HR professionals, and community partners
<br>Members of Fertility Support Singapore</p>
<p>Good evening. Thank you for inviting me to this forum on fertility support
in the workplace.</p>
<p>Today is World IVF Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about the
challenges and advancements in fertility treatments. It is a reminder of
the journeys that many individuals and couples undergo to build their families.</p>
<p>I am really glad to see Fertility Support Singapore (FSS) taking the lead
in driving this. They have organised this platform to talk about fertility
and inclusion in the workplace. The important thing is, by addressing these
issues, we recognise the resilience of couples who have walked this journey,
and reaffirm our commitment to creating supportive environments where both
families and businesses can thrive. It should not be a zero-sum game. It
should be a case if your employees do well, the firm does well too.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Marriage and Parenthood Aspirations</strong>
</p>
<p>Globally, the total fertility rate (TFR) is declining. Singapore is no
exception, with our resident TFR falling to 0.97 in 2023 and remaining
unchanged in 2024. Nonetheless, we understand that many Singaporeans still
aspire to start and raise families. The Government is committed to supporting
couples who are pursuing these aspirations. We have therefore put in place
wide-ranging support measures, including schemes to defray the costs of
childraising, enhancements to parental leave schemes, and efforts to facilitate
flexible work arrangements (FWAs) to help couples better manage work and
family responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Facing Fertility Challenges at Work</strong>
</p>
<p>At the same time, we recognise that there are couples who wish to have
children but have difficulties conceiving. The struggles they face are
deeply personal, often invisible, and sometimes painful. About one in six
couples experience infertility in Singapore<sup>1</sup>. Thanks to FSS,
there is now a safe space to share about this topic. But more than mutual
sharing and support, we really need to shift mindsets and bring these conversations
into the open, and into our workplaces.</p>
<p>Some of us may know of someone at work who has walked the long, uncertain
road of trying to conceive. They have to take time off to go for frequent
and often time-sensitive fertility treatments. Many also experience physical
side effects such as fatigue or discomfort, which can be compounded by
the emotional stress, anxiety, and disappointment from uncertain treatment
outcomes. Yet, they continue to show up for work day after day.</p>
<p>Many also fear the stigma and impact on their career and choose to keep
their struggles private. This silent burden they carry can take a significant
toll on their wellbeing and productivity.</p>
<p>Let me share an FSS member’s story. Fay Robinson first did IVF during
COVID-19 while working from home for a global bank. The remote setup allowed
her to attend doctor visits privately and she had her first baby in 2021.
Post-COVID, in 2023, when she started IVF for a second baby, she had to
work in office and decided to be open with her boss about the treatment.
Her company was supportive – they gave her time off for appointments, FWAs,
and even partially covered IVF costs through their health insurance and
organised fertility support groups among employees. With support from work,
Fay felt more at ease and better able to cope with the physical, emotional
and financial stress that comes with treatment.</p>
<p>This is a happy example, but we really hope to see more of such exemplary
employer support.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Support for Fertility Health</strong>
</p>
<p>On the Government’s end, we provide healthcare subsidies and support to
those who face challenges in conceiving. Today, eligible couples can receive
75% in co-funding for Assisted Reproduction Technology treatments for up
to three fresh and three frozen cycles at public healthcare institutions.
They can also tap on their MediSave for the treatment costs, up to a lifetime
withdrawal limit of $15,000 per patient.</p>
<p>Since 2023, the Ministry of Health has also introduced regulations to
require Assisted Reproduction (AR) centres to offer psychosocial counselling
to patients prior to any AR procedure, and to refer the patients for psychosocial
counselling if assessed to be required at any point during the treatment.
This will help couples be mentally and emotionally prepared for the AR
procedure.</p>
<p>We will also continue to raise awareness on fertility health among Singaporeans,
and to encourage couples to build strong relationships and start families
early, alongside other life goals.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a Supportive Workplace Culture</strong>
</p>
<p>But the Government cannot do this alone. It really needs to be a culture
in the workplace. Workplace support is an important contributor in fostering
an environment where employees feel psychologically safe and assured to
pursue both their personal and work aspirations. We must therefore work
together to support couples in their fertility journeys.</p>
<p>Today, FSS will launch a Fertility Support Guide for employers. The Guide
seeks to raise awareness of the challenges employees face in balancing
work with fertility struggles, and importantly, to encourage a shift in
mindsets for business leaders to see fertility support as a means of talent
retention and building sustainable career paths. As we heard from Christine’s
opening speech, the FSS and Milieu Study showed a positive correlation
between workplace fertility support and talent acquisition and retention
in Singapore.</p>
<p>I understand that some of you have already introduced fertility benefits
such as paid time off, mental health support, and training for managers.
These are excellent steps, and I encourage more companies to come onboard.
Fertility benefits incorporated in HR policies show that employers understand
and are sensitive to the challenges faced by employees in the trying journey
to be parents. By doing so, employee engagement and retention improves.</p>
<p>As business and thought leaders, each of you play a critical role in shaping
workplace culture and HR policies, and you can make a difference to the
lives of employees like Fay. You have the power to create workplaces where
employees feel seen, heard, and supported, and where talents feel cherished
and stand ready to give their all in return to support your business needs.
That is a win-win outcome.</p>
<p>Community partners such as FSS also play a key role in this endeavour
by bringing issues to the forefront, sharing support and resources, and
providing a voice for those who find it challenging to speak up.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, workplace support is key to supporting employees undergoing
fertility treatments. We need to normalise conversations about fertility
at work, and foster workplaces where employees can open up without fear
of stigma, and where all employees can balance both their career and family
aspirations.</p>
<p>Let us work together to make Singapore a great place to work, and a great
place for families.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
