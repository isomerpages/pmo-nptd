<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to be here with you today at the NUS Bia-Echo Asia
Centre for Reproductive Longevity &amp; Equality (ACRLE) conference. The
conference brings together academics, clinicians, policymakers and healthcare
practitioners from different disciplines to discuss the important issues
of reproductive longevity and equality. I welcome such platforms for conversations
and collaborations because they contribute to overall efforts to improve
support for women and families in Singapore and elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Our Population Challenges</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the recent Committee of Supply Debate in Parliament, I shared the two
demographic challenges that Singapore faces – an ageing population, and
a persistently low total fertility rate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Preliminary estimates indicate that our resident total fertility rate
is 0.97 in 2023, dropping below 1.0 for the very first time. While some
part of this can be attributed to Covid-related challenges it is nevertheless
a significant milestone in a long downward trend. This is an existential
issue for us, with implications for our society and economy. With fewer
births, family sizes get smaller, and more Singaporeans will have smaller
and weaker familial support networks that can care for them when they age.
Our workforce will also shrink, making it increasingly challenging to maintain
a strong and vibrant economy, and to create opportunities for the next
generation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Encouraging Singaporeans on Starting Families Early</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fertility is becoming a global issue. While many countries are seeing
a drop in their TFR, given Singapore’s small size, we feel the impact much
more keenly than other countries with larger total populations and greater
resources. Why is fertility falling? The reasons vary. &nbsp;However, one
key reason that appears to be common globally is that individual priorities
and societal norms are shifting. &nbsp;Like many other young people around
the world, Singaporeans are prioritising other life and personal goals
ahead of getting married and having children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But there is a silver lining. The silver lining is that marriage and parenthood
aspirations remain strong among most of our young Singaporeans. A majority
still intend to marry and they do want children.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> So where does this balance out? I think
it really is in the area of competing priorities. Because with more competing
priorities, Singaporeans are now tending to marry and have children later.
There has been a continuing trend towards later marriages and subsequently
later births. The median age of a resident mother at first birth has also
increased from 30.4 years a decade ago, in 2012, to 31.4 years in 2022.
<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u><sup>[2]</sup></u>
</a><sup> </sup>Essentially, as far as the Millennials and the Gen Zs are
concerned, marriage is something that comes after many other milestones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this presents a challenge, because age affects fertility. Studies
show that fertility declines with age for both men and women. Therefore,
if couples are marrying later or marrying but having children later, fertility
is inevitably affected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here in Singapore, we have increased support for couples who have difficulties
conceiving and would like to tap on fertility treatments.</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Government provides co-funding for Assisted Conception Procedures
(ACPs) to defray the costs of starting a family. Today, eligible couples
can receive up to 75% in co-funding from the Government for Assisted Reproduction
Technology (ART) and Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI) treatments at public
healthcare institutions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can also tap on their MediSave to help them with the ACP treatment
costs, up to a lifetime withdrawal limit of $15,000 per patient.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also implemented Elective Egg Freezing last year to give women the
option to preserve their fertility because of personal circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>However, these measures notwithstanding reproduction technologies cannot
fully compensate for age-related decline in fertility. For instance, over
70% of married and single respondents from our 2021 Marriage &amp; Parenthood
Survey think that ART, such as In-vitro Fertilisation (IVF), would have
very high success rates for women above age 40. In reality, based on 2017
to 2021 data in Singapore, the ART success rate was only around 17.2% for
women aged 35 years to 39 years old. This fell to about 6.4% for those
aged 40 and above.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are age-related risks in terms of conceiving and carrying the baby
successfully to term. Thus, we encourage couples, if they can, to pursue
their parenthood plans early.</p>
<p>Besides age, there are also other causes of infertility, such as lifestyle
choices and health conditions. Couples who have difficulty conceiving should
seek medical help early, to check for the causes or factors that affect
their fertility in a timely manner. Fertility cannot be taken for granted
and there is a limited biological window for conceiving successfully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this regard, I am heartened to know that the ACRLE, established under
the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, is trying to find ways to help
women preserve and improve their reproductive systems. &nbsp;I understand
that their research shows the rate of ovarian ageing in each woman differs.
This means that some women could be predisposed to accelerated ageing in
their ovaries and potentially reduced reproductive lifespans. Risk factors
include exposure to gonadotoxic medical treatments such as chemotherapy
and radiotherapy, family history of early menopause, and smoking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Such research is important. If we can better understand the biological,
environmental, and social factors that influence a woman’s reproductive
health and longevity, we can better develop and invest in the appropriate
interventions to support women’s reproductive and general health.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I understand the Centre is also studying the true ovarian lifespan of
women and why menopause occurs, as there is a correlation between a woman’s
reproductive health and her general health. Beyond conception and fertility,
ACRLE’s efforts to deepen knowledge and understanding of the menopause
process can help improve women’s general health, as we spend a significant
portion of our lives in the post-menopausal stage. Prioritising one’s health
will empower our women to lead heathier and more vibrant lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Raising Awareness, Building a Supportive Workplace Culture</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am also glad that research and medical advances have paved the way for
more information exchange and meaningful discussions around improving women’s
reproductive and general health. The Government will continue to do its
part to support couples on their marriage and parenthood journey, including
fertility health treatments. However, medical advances and the Government’s
support alone are not enough. The wider community plays an important role
in providing greater assurance and support to couples with fertility issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fertility health is a difficult topic to broach. We have made some progress.
It is certainly easier to talk about it today than a decade ago but many
still feel embarrassed discussing fertility health concerns. &nbsp;It is
as though they feel that they are lacking in some ways. As such, public
health education and advocacy is very important and I am glad that ACRLE
has identified this as one of the four strategic areas to be featured at
the conference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We must continue to raise awareness on fertility health among Singaporeans.
&nbsp;We should begin by addressing myths about fertility health, such
as the misconception that people who are generally healthy will not have
fertility health issues, or that fertility is only a woman’s issue. Neither
of this is true. Men can suffer from fertility issues as well, not just
age-related but also lifestyle related. We should regard fertility health
in the same way as we regard any other health issue – which is that if
a problem exists it should be addressed as soon as possible and without
stigma. &nbsp;Couples who have issues conceiving should seek medical help
early so that they can receive appropriate and timely interventions. We
must also continue to invest in more upstream efforts, to encourage couples
to build and nurture relationships, and proactively plan for their marriage
and parenthood journey earlier, even as they pursue other aspirations and
goals in their lives. So fertility is not just a medical issue, it is also
a social issue, a lifestyle issue, and we have to see it in that broader
context.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a society, as friends and colleagues, we can be more understanding
and sensitive to the challenges faced by couples undergoing fertility treatments.
The journey can be very lonely and trying. In this vein, grounds-up efforts
can provide valuable community support. For example, Fertility Support
SG, was started in 2020 by a group of ladies who faced fertility health
issues, has created a community where couples facing fertility health concerns
could come together to share their experiences and provide mutual support
in a safe space and they also made it their mission to have an educational
platform so that resources can be shared and couples know where to go for
assistance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Employers must also play their part in making the workplace culture more
family-friendly, and to better support couples in managing work and personal
commitments. HR policies should include couples undergoing fertility treatments,
some of which can be time-sensitive as there are specific windows that
couples must catch for treatment to be administered. &nbsp;Couples may
need to take time off work or require some flexibility in their working
hours to attend these medical appointments. A lot of employers do not understand
that when the woman has to go off for fertility treatment, why the husband
needs time off as well, but they should, because you should see them as
a couple and you see the support for the couple as a whole. One way to
build a family-friendly workplace and environment for families is to adopt
flexible work arrangements (FWA), not to be confused with work from home.
Work From Home is a subset of flexible work arrangements. Flexible work
arrangements is a much broader range, which includes flexi-load, flexi-time,
flexi-space. The new Tripartite Guidelines on FWA Requests, that was launched
last week, will be mandatory for all employers to consider requests for
flexible work arrangements. It sets out how employees should request for
FWAs, as well as how employers should consider these requests and communicate
the outcomes properly.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me conclude by reiterating the importance of research and advocacy
efforts to improve and advance the reproductive health and longevity of
women. Even as the work gets underway, we encourage our young Singaporeans
to actively grow and develop relationships, and plan towards their marriage
and parenthood aspirations early, while they pursue other life goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In parallel, we will also develop a comprehensive suite of strategies,
including policy interventions, and foster societal norms that embrace
children and families, and build family-friendly workplaces and communities.
&nbsp;We must make a whole of society effort to strengthen the overall
ecosystem of support for families and transform Singapore into a place
that is truly Made For Families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your professional perspectives about reproductive
health longevity and I wish you all a fruitful conference. Thank you very
much.
