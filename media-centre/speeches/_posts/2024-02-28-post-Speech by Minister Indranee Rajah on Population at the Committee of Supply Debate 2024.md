<p><strong>Supporting a Stronger Singaporean Citizenry for our Shared Future</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their cuts.</p>
<p>Our vision for Singapore’s population is: a thriving people, a dynamic
economy, an inclusive society, and a resilient nation; a Singapore where
all Singaporeans can:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Achieve their personal and family aspirations;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have good jobs, good incomes and good careers; and</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live fulfilling lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We must also lay the foundations for future generations to do the same.</p>
<p>However, we are confronted with the twin demographic challenges of a persistently
low fertility rate and an ageing population.</p>
<p>These challenges are not unique to Singapore. Many other advanced societies
also face rapidly declining fertility.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>South Korea continues to grapple with a fertility rate below 1.0, far
below the replacement level of 2.1.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closer to home, Malaysia and Thailand saw their fertility rates fall in
2022.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>European countries such as Italy and Spain continue to see record lows
in births year on year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay</strong> and <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked
about the key population outcomes we want and our strategies for achieving
them.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fundamentally, we need more Singaporeans. A strong Singapore citizenry
is the bedrock and wellspring of a thriving nation. We must hence continue
to support Singaporeans in starting and raising families.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we must manage the practical impact of slowing local workforce
growth and an ageing population on our society and economy. This is where
our immigration, foreign workforce, and integration strategies come in.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, we must understand that this task cannot be undertaken by the Government
alone. We can only succeed through our collective efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam</strong> asked about our population projections
and how we plan our population policies.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As indicated at last year’s COS, our total population is likely to be
below 6.9 million by 2030. This planning parameter remains relevant for
the 2030s. Beyond that, our population size will depend on various demographic
trends, such as birth rates, life expectancies, deaths, and migration,
as well as future social and economic needs. In planning for the longer
term, we develop various scenarios to ensure that we are adequately prepared
for a range of possible outcomes, rather than focus on a single number.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all scenarios, however, supporting marriage and parenthood remains
a fundamental priority. We have been and will continue to invest heavily
in families as this is an existential issue for us.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, our efforts to raise fertility will take time to show results. A
carefully managed immigration policy is hence an important supporting measure
to moderate the impact of low birth rates and an ageing population on our
society and families.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So let me now elaborate on our population strategies, the trade-offs we
face, and the whole-of-society effort needed.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of Our Population Challenges</strong>
</p>
<p>At the core of our population vision are strong and stable families.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Last year, there were 26,500 resident marriages. We were also delighted
to welcome 30,500 resident births.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, however, there were fewer resident marriages and births annually
on average over the last five years, as compared to the preceding five-year
period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our resident total fertility rate, or TFR, has continued to decline. Preliminary
estimates indicate a resident TFR of 0.97 in 2023, the first time it has
dropped below 1.0.</p>
<p>There are various reasons for Singapore’s low fertility. Some are temporal,
for instance, couples that had their marriage plans disrupted by COVID-19,
which may in turn have delayed their parenthood plans.</p>
<p>Others cite concerns about the financial costs of child-raising, pressures
to be an excellent parent, or difficulties managing work and family commitments.</p>
<p>More broadly though, our low fertility reflects a global phenomenon where
individual priorities and societal norms have shifted.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This can be seen from a slew of articles on the TFRs of other countries.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These articles reflect a generational change in priorities and how young
people around the world are increasingly finding meaning in other pursuits.
They may not even see marriage or parenthood as important life goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our falling TFR has serious implications for Singapore’s future.</p>
<p>We are already seeing the impact of our falling TFR on our society.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Families today are smaller than before, with more sandwiched couples having
to care for both the young and old.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A growing proportion of Singaporeans are remaining single, and will have
weaker familial support networks when they grow older.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our falling TFR will also impact our economy.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As several Members have mentioned, a strong and vibrant economy is critical
for Singapore, as it helps raise our standard of living and gives us resources
to tackle challenges.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, a vibrant economy is ultimately driven by people. With fewer
births, we will face a shrinking workforce. It will be increasingly challenging
to maintain our dynamism, attract global businesses, and create opportunities
for the next generation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has been the experience of countries like South Korea and Italy,
who are grappling with economic slowdowns and declining wages, further
compounded by low fertility and resulting demographic changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are therefore determined to address these challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Families Through Every Stage of Life</strong>
</p>
<p>The bright side is that our young Singaporeans still aspire towards marriage
and parenthood. However, as several Members have noted, they may not proactively
plan towards these goals.</p>
<p>As a Government, we respect Singaporeans’ personal decisions on marriage
and parenthood. But there is no denying that starting a family becomes
more challenging with age.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singaporeans may prioritise their education or careers in young adulthood,
only to face difficulty conceiving when they eventually try for children.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We therefore strongly encourage young Singaporeans to actively build and
develop relationships, and intentionally factor marriage and parenthood
into their life plans early on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several Members have asked how we will support marriage and parenthood.
We will provide a conducive environment for couples who wish to start,
grow and nurture their families.</p>
<p>We made significant moves in this regard at Budget 2023.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To support working parents, we doubled Government-Paid Paternity Leave
to four weeks on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also increased Unpaid Infant Care Leave to 12 days per parent per year
in their child’s first two years.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To strengthen financial support for young families, we enhanced the Baby
Bonus Cash Gift for all birth orders. We also enhanced the Child Development
Account, or CDA, by increasing the First Step Grant and raising the Government
co-matching caps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are continuing to address the housing needs of Singaporean couples
and families.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HDB has ramped up BTO supply, and remains on track to launch 100,000 BTO
flats from 2021 to 2025.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, HDB is catching up on BTO projects delayed by the pandemic,
having delivered 80% of such projects as of end-2023.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As announced at the National Day Rally last year, the new framework of
Standard, Plus and Prime flats will take effect later this year, and cater
to Singaporean families’ different budgets and needs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MND will help families awaiting the completion of their BTO flats by doubling
the supply of flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme, or
PPHS, to 4,000 units by 2025.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the meantime, as announced at Budget 2024, MND will also introduce
a one-year PPHS (Open Market) Voucher, to support PPHS-eligible families
to rent an HDB flat or bedroom from the open market, and MND will share
more at its COS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng </strong>highlighted, some couples may also
face fertility issues.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Couples undergoing Assisted Conception Procedures at our public hospitals
can tap on Government co-funding, and use their MediSave to offset treatment
costs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOH is also studying the merits of extending co-funding to the private
sector, taking into account clinical outcomes and costs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He asked about elective egg-freezing. Based on preliminary data, approximately
200 women underwent elective egg-freezing since it was implemented in June
last year. But whilst this may be an available option for women, we still
do encourage them to try for children earlier, to reduce age-related risks
of conceiving and carrying a baby successfully to term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling</strong> and <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> asked about
support to alleviate Singaporeans’ concerns regarding child-raising costs.
The Government is investing heavily to ensure preschool, education and
healthcare remain affordable for families.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MSF will lower childcare fee caps in Anchor and Partner Operator Preschools
by $40 in 2025, and will lower them again in 2026. MSF will share more
at their COS.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, a Singaporean child can receive around $200,000 worth of education
subsidies, including preschool subsidies, by the time the child completes
secondary school. And of course, there are significant subsidies for studying
in the IHLs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, all Singaporean babies are covered by Medishield Life from
birth, and their parents receive a Medisave Grant for Newborns to help
with the premiums. And Singaporean children also enjoy fully-subsidised
nationally-recommended childhood vaccinations and developmental screenings
at polyclinics and GP clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We had just enhanced the Baby Bonus Scheme last year, and will consider
the suggestions raised, bearing in mind the overall suite of grants and
subsidies available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support for Fathers</strong>
</p>
<p>Next, we are also focusing on supporting men in their role as husbands
and fathers. Members on both sides of the House support this, and <strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> in
particular has been an active advocate and champion.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our leave provisions are differentiated between mothers and fathers to
meet their respective needs. For example, maternity leave is longer to
allow mothers to recuperate physically from childbirth, and to care for
and bond with their newborns.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, parenthood is a shared responsibility. This is especially
so as more women want to continue to work while raising their children.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, around half of our eligible fathers take paternity leave. We
encourage more to do so, and play a part in caring for your newborns.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies have shown that children benefit physically, cognitively and emotionally
when their fathers are more involved in parenting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Budget 2023, we increased Government-Paid Paternity Leave by two weeks
effective from 1st January 2024, for fathers whose employers are ready
to provide it.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>One father, Mr Daniel Lim, looks forward to this. He and his wife have
two children, and are expecting another in April this year. Daniel welcomes
the additional paternity leave as it allows him to focus on supporting
his wife and caring for his children during this important period.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> asked when we will mandate this additional
paternity leave. We will do so as soon as possible, to benefit more fathers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the meantime, we encourage all employers to start adjusting to ensure
a smoother transition when the mandatory provision eventually kicks in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support for Parents with Infants</strong>
</p>
<p>During our Forward Singapore engagements, parents shared that care needs
are greatest during a child’s first 18 months.</p>
<p>We will continue to strengthen support for parents during this critical
period.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MSF has been ramping up infant care capacity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also plans to grow childminding services as an additional infant care
option for families. MSF will share more at their COS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, we know many Singaporean parents prefer to care for their infants
themselves, and have asked if more leave can be given.</p>
<p>We have studied the leave provisions of other developed countries like
France and Denmark which have higher TFRs.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>These countries tend to provide parents with longer periods of leave during
their child’s infancy, sometimes at reduced pay.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents appreciate the greater peace of mind, as they can care for their
infants for longer while remaining employed. They can then return to work
more easily once their children are older.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are therefore actively exploring how to increase paid parental leave.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We must recognise that this requires workplace adjustments, and that employers
may face challenges in making arrangements to cover for employees’ extended
absences.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will therefore closely engage Tripartite Partners on further enhancements,
and pace out any proposed changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support at Workplaces</strong>
</p>
<p>Caring for and raising our children is a long-term endeavour. As <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> and <strong>Ms Rachel Ong</strong> have
pointed out, this can be especially challenging when children fall sick,
or for certain groups such as parents of children with severe disabilities
or rare disorders.</p>
<p>Hence, beyond leave provisions, we are exploring other sustainable ways
to help parents better manage work and family commitments. These include
flexible work arrangements, or FWAs.</p>
<p>We must strengthen workplace flexibility in a manner that meets the needs
of both employees and employers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As <strong>Ms Carrie Tan</strong> mentioned, we want to provide parents
with flexibility to optimise their energies as they navigate the demands
of work and family. At the same time, employers’ ability to meet their
business needs will be critical in sustaining such flexibility. Through
open communication and mutual trust, employers and employees can work out
arrangements that meet both their needs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOM is working with Tripartite Partners to develop new Tripartite Guidelines
on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests. MOM will share more at their COS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling </strong>asked about Government support for employers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We recognise that some companies, including SMEs, may find it more challenging
to adopt FWAs. We will consider ways to help all employers implement FWAs
well and manage their teams productively. These are HR capabilities that
will enable our employers to optimise their workforce and position themselves
as employers of choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>36. We are glad to see more employers distinguishing themselves by implementing
family-friendly practices and features.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>One such local company is Hegen, which develops infant care products.
Hegen offers its employees various forms of workplace flexibility, including
work-from-home arrangements, staggered hours, part-time work and compressed
work schedules. Hegen’s family-friendly culture has helped the company
to attract and retain talent, showing that businesses can pursue excellence
and innovation while at the same time implementing family-friendly practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage all employers to establish family-friendly workplaces, and
make a difference in practical ways.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For example, fathers ought to feel supported when taking time off for
their families. A CNA report cited an example of a father who wanted to
take paternity leave, but encountered resistance from his female manager.
She made passive-aggressive comments and pointed to the backlog of work
he would accumulate if he did so. It would have been more helpful to discuss
a mutually satisfactory covering arrangement instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Employer support can also include family-friendly office features such
as lactation rooms, which <strong>Mr Louis Ng </strong>spoke about.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Building and Construction Authority, or BCA, has progressively enhanced
the building design requirements for lactation rooms, and will continue
to review them.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We encourage building owners to voluntarily provide such family-friendly
features beyond the minimum Code requirements. Premises which lack space
for separate lactation facilities can consider lactation pods which are
commercially available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building owners, lessors and lessees of eligible private developments
may also tap on BCA’s Accessibility Fund to co-fund the construction costs
of such features, as well as lactation pods. BCA has actively promoted
the Fund via press releases, social media posts, industry seminars and
targeted engagements. They will continue to reach out to building owners
to encourage adoption.But ultimately, it will require a whole-of-society
effort to build the family-friendly workplace culture that Members have
called for. All of us have a role to play, whether as parents, employers
or co-workers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We want parents to be able to tap on workplace flexibilities without fear
of stigma. Every small act counts, from exercising patience when a colleague’s
child interrupts a work call, to being understanding when a co-worker takes
time off at short notice to care for their children.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also trust that parents will tap on these flexibilities responsibly,
and stand ready to reciprocate when other colleagues have urgent personal
or family needs to attend to.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together, we can make Singapore a great place for all to work and live
in, for generations to come.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked about supporting the needs of an
ageing population. Indeed, a key thrust of Forward Singapore is enabling
our seniors to age well.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primarily, we want our seniors to have good health. Good health is a lifelong
commitment, as lifestyles in earlier years affect how healthy we are in
our golden years.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, we will step up the preventive health focus through Healthier
SG, to empower Singaporeans to live healthily with support from their regular
family doctor.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also want our seniors to age well in their homes and the community.
This is the key purpose of Age Well SG, which complements Healthier SG
by anchoring ageing well in the community.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through Age Well SG, we will encourage active ageing, improve support
for seniors with care needs, and make our homes and neighbourhoods more
senior friendly.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOH, MND and MOT will share more information on their Age Well SG plans
during their respective COS segments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Gan asked about the number of Migrant Domestic Workers, or MDWs, needed
to support our ageing population.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We expect that demand for elderly caregiving services will rise in the
coming years, and MDWs play an important role in supporting households
with caregiving needs. However, the scale of this increase is uncertain.
It will be dependent on a host of factors, including how well our society
ages and other efforts to support seniors with care needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengthening our Citizen Population</strong>
</p>
<p>Even as we strive to support Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood
aspirations, and help seniors live healthier and more fulfilling lives,
low birth rates and ageing will undeniably impact our economy and society.</p>
<p>Our immigration policies play an important role in mitigating this.</p>
<p>In 2023, we granted about 23,500 new citizenships, including about 1,300
to children born overseas to Singaporean parents. We also granted about
34,500 new Permanent Residencies (PRs).</p>
<p>We continue to maintain a measured and stable pace of immigration, which
moderates the impact of demographic trends on the size and age profile
of the citizen population.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The average number of new citizenships and new PRs granted per year since
2019 is slightly higher than that over the preceding period.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We grant PR or citizenship to those who can integrate well, contribute
to Singapore, and are committed to making Singapore their home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our immigration policy also helps us to meet our future population needs.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For example, in recent years we have granted a higher number of PRs to
healthcare workers to support our growing healthcare needs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One such immigrant is Ms Josephine Marie Baljon Celis, who was granted
PR in 2023. She has been a valued staff nurse at SingHealth Community Hospitals
for almost 15 years, consistently delivering a high standard of care to
her patients. Josephine’s colleagues describe her as friendly, positive,
and dedicated to her work. Beyond her core nursing duties, she has served
as a Clinical Instructor for many years, guiding and training numerous
batches of nursing students to help meet Singapore’s healthcare needs.
She also does volunteer work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like our forefathers, many immigrants have found their way here and stayed
on because they hope for a better life in Singapore. With time, they become
our friends, and ultimately our fellow countrymen who will work alongside
us to build a brighter shared future.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Opportunities for Singaporeans</strong>
</p>
<p>But crucial to this brighter shared future is a strong economy, supported
by a dynamic and productive workforce.</p>
<p>As <strong>Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Joan Pereira</strong>, and <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> have
noted, for Singaporeans to have good jobs, good incomes and access to services
for high quality of life, we need a strong economy.</p>
<p>Our low birth rates and ageing population have resulted in slowing local
workforce growth.</p>
<p>Even with immigrants, we do not have enough working locals to support
continued good economic growth.</p>
<p>We must therefore remain open to a diverse foreign workforce that complements
the local workforce. Foreign workers create value for Singaporeans, for
example by filling manpower gaps in sectors that Singaporeans are less
keen to work in, or in disciplines where we may need more time to develop
our own pool of local workers. They can also generate opportunities for
Singaporeans by bringing in new investments, networks, and expertise.</p>
<p>So even as we welcome these complementary foreign workers, we will continue
to strengthen the development of the local workforce.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As detailed in the Forward Singapore report, SkillsFuture is a key pillar
of our social compact.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also support Singaporeans in gaining overseas work experience,
to provide opportunities for career development and progression. More information
will be provided during MTI’s and MOM’s COS segments, and we encourage
all Singaporeans to make the most of these opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengthening Solidarity and Building a More Resilient, Cohesive Society</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, I have outlined how our marriage and parenthood, immigration,
and workforce policies work in tandem to help us overcome our population
challenges.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>However, these policies can only succeed if we remain an inclusive society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Globally, sentiments of disenfranchisement and xenophobia have gained
momentum.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A growing number of politicians across the world have stoked xenophobia
to gain popular support. Some have been voted into office, the result of
which has been division and instability.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must not go down that path.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The well-being of Singaporeans remains at the heart of what we do. But
this does not prevent us from welcoming foreigners who can contribute to
our economy and add richness to our multicultural society. And we must
of course also work hard at integration.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This response extends to the enquiry Mr Faisal Manap made about how we
can welcome Malays and others from the region to come and join us. All
that I said earlier about welcoming foreigners here extends to those groups
as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Resilient Nation</strong>
</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, Mr Chairman, Singaporeans and their well-being are
at the heart of our population strategies. These strategies aim to build
a resilient nation, anchored on the key thrusts of the Forward Singapore
Report: opportunities, assurance, and collective responsibility.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Government is committed to building an economy that will provide opportunities
for all to achieve their aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government will also provide assurance for Singaporeans at every stage
of life. We will not let up on efforts to support Singaporeans in starting
and raising families, so that we may forge a strong Singaporean citizenry.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this to happen, we need everyone to do their part. While some of the
bolder changes and mindset shifts may require more time, I call on everyone
– individuals, families, employers, and communities, to contribute towards
shaping a Singapore that is Made for Families so that we can secure our
future and thrive for years to come.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
