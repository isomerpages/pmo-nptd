<p>Chairman, with your permission, Minister Indranee Rajah and I will take
any clarifications after both our speeches.</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Earlier I spoke about the urgent realities of climate change. Now, I turn
to a challenge equally fundamental to Singapore’s future – our population.</p>
<p>Our people are our primary resource. In the early years of our independence,
demographics worked in our favour. While many of our forefathers were new
immigrants, most had become citizens. We had a young and growing citizen
population then, which helped grow our economy, build up our SAF, and develop
our nation.</p>
<p>Fast forward 60 years, this is no longer the case today. Birth rates are
falling at an unprecedented pace, and our population is ageing rapidly.
We are not alone in facing these trends. Many developed and even developing
countries are grappling with these same issues. However, Singapore’s small
size makes us exceptionally sensitive to demographic shifts. We must proactively
manage these changes, to continue to thrive as a nation.</p>
<p><strong><u>Addressing Our Demographic Challenges</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Last year, we welcomed around 27,500 resident births<sup>1</sup>. We celebrate
each and every child born to us. They are the future of our country. However,
this is the lowest number ever in our recorded history. The overall trend
is of grave concern. Marriage rates have come down, and those who are married
have fewer or no children.</p>
<p><strong>Our birth rate has reached a new low. Our preliminary resident total fertility rate (TFR) for 2025 is 0.87. </strong>This
is a significant drop from the TFR of 0.97 the year before, and much lower
than the TFR of 1.24 just a decade ago.</p>
<p>At the same time, our population is ageing faster than ever, with the
baby boomer generation now in their 60s and beyond. Last year, 1 in 5 citizens
was aged 65 and above, compared to 1 in 8 in 2015, just ten years ago.
This is an existential challenge.</p>
<p>What does a TFR of 0.87 mean? Let me try to illustrate.</p>
<p>Assuming our TFR stays at 0.87 – based on a simplistic calculation, for
every 100 residents today, we will have just 44 children, and a mere 19
grandchildren.<sup>2</sup> Over time, it will be practically impossible
to reverse the trend, because we will have fewer and fewer women who can
bear children.</p>
<p>PM said we have not given up, and he emphasised we will not give up. Let
me add – we cannot give up.</p>
<p>Low birth rates and an ageing population will profoundly reshape our nation,
our society and our economy in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Even with immigration, the growth of our citizen population has slowed
over the past decade – falling from an average of 0.9% per annum over 2015-2020,
to 0.8% per annum over 2020-2025. Last year, it grew just 0.7%. If no new
measures are taken, our citizen population will start to shrink by the
early part of the 2040s.</p>
<p>Fewer births today mean fewer young people over the next two to three
decades. A smaller working-age base will have to support a rapidly growing
elderly population; familial support networks will weaken as family sizes
shrink. Each family member in the younger generation will have to carry
a heavier load.At the macro level, a declining population means less vitality
in our city and our economy. Our economic growth, and correspondingly,
our income growth will slow. At the same time, our healthcare and social
spending will have to increase to support our growing population of seniors.
This tremendous strain will be felt at the national level, but also by
individual households. And with fewer citizens, it will become increasingly
difficult to meet our national security and national defence needs.</p>
<p>This raises the deeper question of what Singapore will be 50 or 100 years
from now – will we remain vibrant, liveable and relevant?</p>
<p><strong><u>Supporting Singaporeans’ Marriage &amp; Parenthood Aspirations</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our first and top priority is to continue to support Singaporeans in forming families.</strong>
</p>
<p>Over the years, we have consistently invested in our families. We have
steadily enhanced support for families in housing, preschool, education
and healthcare. To better support working parents in managing their work
and caregiving responsibilities, we also recently introduced the new Shared
Parental Leave scheme and doubled the mandatory Government-Paid Paternity
Leave from two weeks to four weeks.</p>
<p>But we will need to do even more. The decline in fertility is a multifaceted
challenge. It reflects broader generational shifts in life priorities and
mindsets. Attitudes towards marriage and parenthood are shaped by many
factors – workplace norms and employer practices, availability of familial
and community support, and social attitudes towards having and raising
children. We need to address these issues holistically and not simply blame
it on any particular, single factor.</p>
<p><strong>We will do more to strengthen support for Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood journey.</strong> Minister
Indranee will speak later about the whole-of-nation reset needed to support
Singaporeans in starting families.</p>
<p><strong><u>Immigration as a Necessary Measure</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Let me speak plainly about the realities before us. Even as we redouble
our efforts to support Singaporeans in starting families and having more
children, <strong>we will still need a carefully managed immigration flow to augment our low birth rate.</strong>
</p>
<p>Most Singaporeans recognise the case for immigration. A 2021 Institute
of Policy Studies survey found that over 75% of Singaporeans agreed that
immigrants are generally good for Singapore’s economy, and 62% agreed that
immigrants improve Singapore society by bringing in new ideas and culture.</p>
<p>But we know that’s not the full picture. While Singaporeans can accept
the need for immigration in the abstract, we also have personal concerns
and anxieties. Will bringing in immigrants mean fewer job opportunities
for me? Will the Singapore that my children grow up in feel vastly different
from the one I grew up in? I understand these concerns.</p>
<p>We take these concerns over competition and our social fabric seriously,
and will continue taking steps to address them.</p>
<p>We will maintain the broad ethnic balance of our citizen population, and
continue to carefully manage the impact of immigration on our population
composition, to preserve the overall texture of our society.</p>
<p>We will <u>carefully manage the pace of immigration</u>, and ensure we
do not bring in immigrants in faster than we can accommodate. This means
making sure the development of public infrastructure like housing, transport
and services keeps pace with the growth of our population.</p>
<p>We will also <u>continue to be selective about who we bring in</u>. As <strong>Mr Edward Chia</strong> noted,
many of the immigrants we take in today either share family ties with Singaporeans
or have studied, worked or lived in Singapore for some time. The majority
of our immigrants are also of working age, contributing to our economy.
We will continue to explore further ways to ensure that immigrants are
committed to Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Shawn Loh </strong>spoke about how we must place greater emphasis
on integration. We agree. We will <u>step up integration efforts</u>, creating
more opportunities for citizens and immigrants to interact, connect, and
build relationships and trust.</p>
<p>There are ongoing efforts to help immigrants integrate and become familiar
with local culture. All new citizens between the ages of 16 and 60 go through
the Singapore Citizenship Journey, so that they understand our history,
our norms, our values, and build stronger ties with the local community.
We also piloted a new Permanent Resident (PR) Journey programme last year
to help new PRs settle in and integrate, and we intend to scale it up in
shortly.</p>
<p>The People’s Association is also working through its network of over 1,500
Integration and Naturalisation Champions to drive integration in local
communities, and foster good relations between new citizens and their Singaporean
neighbours.</p>
<p>Our immigrants came from different cultures and traditions. It will take
time for them to integrate. First-generation immigrants will need to adapt
to our norms and customs; but their children are likely to integrate more
easily, especially if they grow up in Singapore.</p>
<p>Take for example Bipule Jain, who arrived in Singapore in 2007 with his
wife and six-month-old son on a work assignment. What began as a temporary
re-location became permanent, as his Singaporean colleagues welcomed him
and introduced him to our local culture. Bipule actively immersed himself
in the local community – trying local food, picking up Singlish, volunteering
at his son’s school and in the community, and making new friends along
the way.</p>
<p>In 2017, he took a significant step by enlisting in the SAF Volunteer
Corps, initially to teach his sons about National Service, but he soon
developed a deep passion for defending Singapore. Today, Bipule’s elder
son – that six-month-old baby who arrived in 2007 – is following in his
father’s footsteps and proudly serving his National Service. Bipule, his
wife and his two sons are PRs, and have applied for citizenship.</p>
<p>Their story shows us what is possible when we open up our doors and hearts
to newcomers. Over time, many of them become our friends, and eventually
fellow citizens, working together in one Singapore team to build a brighter,
better home for all of us.</p>
<p>It is critical that we maintain a stable citizen core, hopefully one that
is growing modestly over time, to keep our society and our economy dynamic
and vibrant.</p>
<p>Last year, we granted around 25,000 citizenships. <strong>We expect to take in between 25,000 and 30,000 new citizens annually, over the next five years, depending on our demographic trends including our TFR.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>We will also have to adjust our PR intake</strong>, as permanent
residence is the pathway to work towards citizenship. Our PR population
has remained stable over the past few years, at around 540,000. <strong>We estimate an intake of about 40,000 PRs annually in the next five years, slightly higher than the 35,000 PRs we granted last year.</strong>
</p>
<p>That said, we will adjust the actual number of immigrants we take in year
by year, depending on our TFR trends, other demographic factors, and the
number and suitability of applicants. We will also keep in mind our infrastructure
and society’s capacity to take in these immigrants.</p>
<p>With these adjustments, we hope to maintain a stable citizen population,
and perhaps with a modest growth. Like I mentioned earlier, the growth
of our citizen population has slowed down, from 0.9% to 0.8% and then 0.7%
last year. Going forward, the citizen population will likely grow even
more slowly, maybe about half a percent. That’s what we’re thinking about.
But even at half a percent this is going to be hard, as it would rely on
the TFR being held up. That’s why we cannot give up.</p>
<p>We will review again by 2030, taking into account further changes in our
TFR and other demographic trends.</p>
<p><strong><u>Managing Our Foreign Workforce</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our local workforce growth has also slowed. We will continue to need a
diverse foreign workforce to supplement the local workforce, and support
our economic and social needs.</p>
<p>In the past five years, our foreign workforce<sup>3</sup> grew at an average
of 3.3% per annum, primarily driven by post-COVID catch-up in construction.
Excluding Construction Work Permit Holders, the foreign workforce grew
more slowly, at an average of 2.5% per annum. But as our citizen population
grows more slowly, we will keep a close watch on the growth of the non-resident
population, which includes foreign workers, to ensure that Singapore citizens
remain the majority of the population.</p>
<p>As we bring in foreign workers, our policies are designed to ensure they
complement our Singaporean core.</p>
<p>As announced at Budget, we will increase our Employment Pass (EP) and
S Pass qualifying salaries to keep pace with local wage benchmarks. The
Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) also ensures that firms
bring in workers that contribute to our economy, while the firms continue
to build up their local talent pipeline. We will continue to carefully
manage the numbers and concentrations of EP and S Pass holders, and ensure
that they complement rather than compete with locals. We will also carefully
manage the number of Work Permit Holders using levy and quota systems.</p>
<p>We need skilled foreign workers to help fill critical manpower gaps, to
help our companies build up new capabilities, and to support the growth
of our economy. This ultimately creates more jobs and opportunities for
our people.</p>
<p>Take for example, aerospace company Singapore Aero Engine Services Private
Limited (SAESL), Rolls-Royce’s largest global Maintenance, Repair and Operations
facility for Trent engines, currently employs 1,300 local staff. With a
$242 million expansion and a new Training Academy supporting its growth
plans, SAESL expects to create 500 additional jobs for local skilled engine
technicians over the next five years.</p>
<p>SAESL is working with Singapore Polytechnic to align its training curriculum
with industry needs to better prepare our students to take up these jobs.
This expansion will be complemented by a foreign workforce undertaking
specialised roles such as non-destructive testing and plasma treatment.</p>
<p>There are many other companies like SAESL whose growth has generated new
opportunities for Singaporean workers. Overall, in the last 10 years, the
number of Singaporeans in PMET jobs has increased by 308,000 while the
number of EP and S Pass holders increased by 24,000.</p>
<p>But we understand the job anxieties Singaporeans have, especially in this
time of global uncertainty.</p>
<p>The number of EP and S Pass holders is small, making up less than a quarter
of our foreign workforce. The issue is therefore less about the total number,
but about issues of job competition and fair treatment at the workplace,
as raised by<strong> Mr Xie Yao Quan</strong> and<strong> Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong>.</p>
<p>We are stepping up efforts not only to create good jobs for Singaporeans,
but to upskill Singaporeans so they can take up these high-value jobs.
At the same time, we will strengthen measures to ensure fair hiring and
employment practices, and to ensure fair opportunities for Singaporeans.
Last year, we passed the Workplace Fairness Act to strengthen protections
against workplace discrimination.</p>
<p>Lastly, beyond legislative and policy safeguards, we can do more to make
the workplace more conducive for all. MCCY has partnered the business community
via the Alliance for Action on the Integration of Foreign Professionals,
to develop initiatives to better integrate foreign professionals into the
workplace and the community.</p>
<p>MCCY and MOM will elaborate further on some of these initiatives at their
Committee of Supply debates.</p>
<p>As <strong>Mr Edward Chia</strong> and<strong> Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> noted,
we also need foreign workers to meet our social needs. And they asked if
we can have more flexibility.</p>
<p>For example, migrant domestic workers help look after our young children
and aged parents, giving us peace of mind while we are out at work. We
also need migrant construction workers for major infrastructure projects
– they help build our flats, hospitals, roads, MRT lines and critical projects
like Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Port. These workers make up almost
half of our foreign workforce population.</p>
<p>Demand for these groups will fluctuate, depending on economic and construction
cycles. For example, post-COVID, we had to catch up on a series of important
construction projects, including BTO flats. This strong demand led to a
6% annual growth, or a 36% growth cumulatively, in the number of Construction
Work Permit Holders over the last five years.</p>
<p>These migrant workers are transient and do not compete with Singaporeans
for jobs. But it is important that we plan ahead to support their presence
here, including catering for dormitories and housing, transport and recreational
spaces.</p>
<p>If we can do this well, it will give us more flexibility and capacity
to allow for temporary surges in their numbers, while minimising the impact
felt by Singaporeans. At the same time, we will press hard to raise productivity
in construction – MND set up an Action Team earlier this month to work
with industry players to improve productivity, and help companies save
time, save costs and save manpower.</p>
<p>Across the board, we will do what we can to raise productivity to reduce
our reliance on foreign manpower. The recent moves to simplify the levy
framework, expand sources, and raise the maximum age and period of employment
for Work Permit Holders, will nudge businesses to hire and retain higher-skilled
workers, so they can do more with less manpower.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, our total population for the next five years will hopefully
still grow, but most likely at a slower rate than over the past five years.
And our total population will still be significantly below 6.9 million
by 2030, as we have said earlier. Beyond 2030, if present trends continue,
it will take us a considerable time to reach 6.9 million.</p>
<p>Let me be clear that we are not chasing growth for the sake of growth’s
sake. Economic growth is the means to an end, which is to improve the lives
of Singaporeans. Our overarching goal has been and will always remain to
serve the interests of Singaporeans. We will keep close track of the population
size and composition, to ensure that the trends are sustainable, that infrastructure
needs are met in a timely and adequate manner, and that ultimately, Singaporeans
ultimately benefit from our population policies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To conclude, our falling TFR presents a serious and profound existential
challenge to our society, our economy and our security.</p>
<p>The Government must, and will do its utmost to address this challenge.
This is our commitment to all Singaporeans.</p>
<p>We will redouble our efforts to support Singaporeans to aspire to marriage
and parenthood, and to realise their dream. This has always been and will
continue to be our fundamental priority. We must never let up in supporting
Singaporeans to have families. We will also continue to review our immigration
intake and approach, making sure to address the concerns of Singaporeans.</p>
<p>We will continue to study how we can further strengthen our investment
in key areas for Singaporeans – education, housing, healthcare and jobs.
This way, every Singaporean will have the assurances, opportunities and
support needed to realise his or her aspiration in our shared vision.</p>
<p>But the existential challenge of our low TFR is not something that the
Government can tackle on our own. We ask Singaporeans to partner us in
this effort, and welcome all debate and fresh ideas on how to do so.</p>
<p>Our path ahead will not be straightforward. But I am confident in our
ability to adapt and thrive. Together, we will build a vibrant and resilient
Singapore for present and future generations.</p>
