<p>President of YWCA, Ms Sim Hwee Hoon</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p></p>
<p>A very good afternoon to all. It is my honour to join you today at this
very special occasion – the official launch of the YWCA’s Hopemaker Movement
and Women’s Business Accelerator Programme, in commemoration of YWCA’s
150<sup>th</sup> year of empowering women in Singapore. That’s amazing –
150 years of empowering women. Give yourselves a big hand!</p>
<p>&nbsp;To reach 150 is truly a remarkable milestone. For generations, YWCA
has pioneered various initiatives to support women in Singapore. These
150 years speak of the legacy that YWCA has left. A legacy of love, service
and community – of women helping women, and uplifting families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that women often juggle multiple roles in their lives – as mothers,
caregivers, breadwinners and more. Many do so with strength and quiet resilience.
It is not easy managing work while raising children, caring for elderly
family members while navigating economic uncertainties, or striving to
improve their lives while dealing with daily responsibilities. These challenges
are felt even more acutely by women from disadvantaged backgrounds who
may have limited access to education or training, unstable employment,
unsafe home environments, or a lack of support networks. Without the right
resources and opportunities, it is incredibly difficult for these women
to break out of the cycle of hardship and build a better future for themselves
and their families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the Government’s part, we are doing more to support vulnerable families.
Through initiatives like ComCare, we provide financial assistance to help
lower-income households meet their daily living expenses, and grants and
subsidies to ensure that housing, education, and healthcare remain accessible
and affordable. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, the Government
has also shifted our focus beyond just providing assistance for basic needs
to empowering families to achieve their aspirations. One way we do so is
via ComLink+, where family coaches journey with families and co-create
action plans that are tailored to their strengths, needs and goals. Through
the ComLink+ Progress Packages, we boost families’ efforts by providing
financial top-ups to those who take action in pre-school enrolment and
attendance, employment, debt clearance and home ownership.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Government cannot do this alone. Partners like YWCA are critical in
helping us achieve the goal of helping every family achieve stability,
self-reliance and social mobility.&nbsp; And in YWCA’s case, they do so
by offering a range of programmes to uplift women facing challenging circumstances.</p>
<p></p>
<p>YWCA’s Hopemaker Movement marks a bold new step forward in supporting
women and creating opportunities for them to thrive. By affirming potential,
building confidence and facilitating access to meaningful economic and
social participation, the programmes under the Hopemaker Movement will
empower women and their families, helping them achieve greater financial
stability and security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am happy to see how the Women’s Business Accelerator Programme – the
first initiative launched under the Hopemaker Movement – is already making
an impact. It supports women from low-income or marginalised backgrounds,
by providing them with training, mentorship and resources to turn their
micro-businesses into sustainable and scalable ones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have heard the powerful stories of women – Cathy, who wants to build
a ceramic business with her son; Afiqah, who is creating a halal food brand
rooted in heritage and resilience; and Cherry, who is turning beauty and
wellness into a pathway of healing and hope for others to experience. These
are stories of real inspiration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To all Hopemakers embarking on this journey with YWCA’s Business Accelerator
Programme, I offer you my best wishes and encouragement. You are taking
a courageous step to make hope happen for yourself and your families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Partners like YWCA show us how a whole-of-society effort enables us to
build a stronger and more caring society. They play an essential role in
our support ecosystem – by understanding needs, mobilising expertise and
resources, and delivering care and support to those who need it. We look
forward to more of such efforts and partnerships, so we can all work together
to build a more caring and inclusive society for all.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations to YWCA on your incredible 150-year journey.
Thank you so much for inviting me.</p>
