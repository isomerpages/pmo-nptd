<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, I thank<strong> Ms Hany Soh</strong> and <strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong> for
moving the motion on this important topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motion has two parts. The first calls for the Government to continue
reviewing policies that will support families, marriage and parenthood.
This has been echoed by many of the suggestions and proposals made by Members
in the House today. The second calls for a whole-of-society approach, which
is a call to everyone else, in addition to the Government, to do our part
to support families and Singaporeans’ marriage and parenthood aspirations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, I support both parts of the motion. And I will go on to explain
why.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong> has proposed an amendment to the motion.
I will deal with that later.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Supporting Families as a National Priority</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Supporting Singaporeans in starting and raising families has and continues
to be a top national priority. Families are the building blocks of our
society. They are our first line of support and a key pillar of our social
compact. At an individual level, our families are the ones who give our
lives meaning and purpose.</p>
<p><strong><u>Global Trends on Families</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Globally, family formation and fertility rates have run into headwinds.
All around the world, not just in Singapore, more are delaying marriage
or not marrying at all, and even if they are married, more are having children
later, having fewer children or not having children at all. Reasons include
changing societal norms around marriage and parenthood, prioritisation
of careers and other life goals, and concerns about the demands of child-raising.
These reasons resonate with many Singaporeans too. After all, the decision
to marry and have children is a deeply personal one. But we know from our
surveys that the majority of Singaporeans aspire to get married and have
children. This is encouraging and gives hope for the future.</p>
<p>We have engaged Singaporeans to understand their thoughts about marriage
and parenthood. Many of their concerns and challenges have been debated
and discussed in the Chamber today, namely: Housing, costs, competitive
stress, time.</p>
<p>Housing – because couples want a home of their own. Costs – as in the
costs of raising children. Competitive stress – particularly in education.
And time – which is perhaps the most precious commodity of all, covering
a multitude of issues, including caregiving, and managing work alongside
family commitments.</p>
<p>On these, in the last five years, we have made major shifts and bold moves
to help families secure affordable homes, manage the costs and stresses
of raising children, and balance work and family responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong><u>Homes – The First Step to Starting Families</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The first step for many couples is to secure their own home, where they
can build a new life together and start a family.</p>
<p>Supporting first-time married applicants is a key priority of our public
housing policies. We set aside up to 95% of our public flat supply for
first-timers.</p>
<p><em>Supply of flats</em>
</p>
<p>We started this term of Government in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,
which severely disrupted our building programme and caused a public housing
crunch. However, through the efforts of HDB and MND working with the built
environment sector, we are now back on track. All COVID-delayed BTO projects
have been completed.</p>
<p>In parallel, we significantly ramped up flat supply. We have not only
met our commitment to launch 100,000 BTO flats from 2021 to 2025 but are
set to exceed it. We launched 19,600 new flats last year and will launch
another 19,600 BTO flats this year. We will continue to put out a steady
pipeline of flats to meet housing demand in the next few years, and are
launching more than 50,000 flats between 2025 (inclusive) and 2027. We
are also launching over 5,500 Sale of Balance or SBF flats later this month.
SBF flats tend to have shorter waiting times, which will help families
who are looking to move into a new home more quickly.</p>
<p>To help reduce the waiting time for flats, we committed to launching 2,000
to 3,000 Shorter Waiting Time or SWT flats every year. We met the target
last year with the launch of 2,800 SWT flats. <strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong> has
asked if we can further increase the supply of SWT flats. This year we
aim to exceed our target, with 3,800 such flats, and we will continue to
explore launching more SWT flats in coming years.</p>
<p>Collectively, these moves have helped to bring down median waiting times
to pre-COVID levels of three to four years, compared to four to five years
during the peak of the pandemic. Several Members have asked if this could
be further reduced, down to even 18 months. There are practical and operational
challenges to further shortening waiting times. These include difficult
site conditions, extensive land preparation required, need for consultation
with stakeholder groups, and construction industry capacity. But we will
do our best.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong> suggested providing a “quality rental
option” for couples waiting for the new flats in the form of the Millennial
Apartment Scheme or the MAS. We do have quality rental options for this
group – it’s called the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme, or the PPHS.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked about relaxing the criteria and
increasing the supply of flats under the PPHS to help those who need a
place while waiting for their BTO flat. As flat supply is limited, the
reality is that we will still have to prioritise PPHS flats for those with
greater needs. That said, we will double the number of PPHS flats to 4,000
units by this year. In the meantime, we have introduced the PPHS (Open
Market) Voucher as a temporary bridging measure to support households renting
an HDB flat or bedroom on the open market. The voucher defrays around 10%
of the median three-room flat rent, or 40% of the cost of renting a HDB
bedroom. Around 160 couples have applied for the voucher to date.</p>
<p><em>Accessibility of flats</em>
</p>
<p>We have also been working hard to improve accessibility of BTO flats.</p>
<p>We introduced the First-Timer (Parents and Married Couples) or FT(PMC)
priority category to help young married couples and families with young
children secure their first homes more quickly. Since introduction, about
9 in 10 FT(PMC) applicants have been invited to book a flat at each sales
launch.</p>
<p><em>Affordability of flats</em>
</p>
<p>We have also made significant moves to keep HDB housing affordable.</p>
<p>To help younger couples who are entering the job market but have not yet
started to earn and build up their savings to get flats early, we introduced
the Deferred Income Assessment scheme and the Staggered Downpayment Scheme
for full-time students and National Servicemen.</p>
<p>We also made a major move last year to introduce the new HDB flat classification
framework. The increased subsidies for Plus and Prime flats make flats
in these locations more affordable for Singaporean couples.</p>
<p>We also enhanced housing subsidies and grants for first-time buyers. These
include the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG), the CPF Housing Grant for
Resale Flats, and the Proximity Housing Grant. With the increased EHG in
August 2024, a first-time married couple can benefit from grants of up
to $120,000 for BTO flats and up to $230,000 for resale flats.</p>
<p>We know there are still concerns about the resale market. <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> raised
concerns about the Cash Over Valuation or COV component. Resale housing
prices have risen over the last few years, driven by strong demand, as
well as some temporary tightness in the supply of newly MOP-ed flats. These
flats also tended to be in more attractive or central locations last year.
Nevertheless, the vast majority of resale flats remain affordable. Most
resale flat buyers do not have to pay any COV. We have also implemented
several rounds of cooling measures to moderate demand, while increasing
support for lower-to-middle income households. These measures will take
time to work their way through the market. <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> suggested
indexing our grants to the resale market. We do not do so, as this could
inadvertently further fuel resale price increases. For example, some sellers
may attempt to factor in grant increases in their asking price. This is
why we are careful in reviewing grant amounts in tandem with income growth
and affordability outcomes, and means-test our grants to target support
towards buyers who need it the most.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, <strong>Mr Faisal Manap</strong> raised two points: on divorced
parents and transnational families. As he spoke in Malay, please permit
me to reply in Malay.</p>
<p>Encik Faisal meminta kami membenarkan ibu bapa yang sedang melalui proses
perceraian dan memerlukan rumah dengan segera untuk memohon bagi mendapatkan
rumah sewa awam sebelum perceraian itu dimuktamadkan.</p>
<p>Pemerintah memahami dan bersimpati sepenuhnya dengan kebimbangan pasangan
yang bercerai.</p>
<p>Mungkin Encik Faisal tidak sedar tetapi sebenarnya pada masa ini, HDB
sudah pun membenarkan individu yang telah memulakan proses perceraian untuk
memohon bagi mendapatkan rumah sewa, bahkan sebelum Keputusan Sementara
atau Muktamad diperolehi. Kami telah memaklumkan tentang perkara ini dalam
jawapan kepada Soalan Parlimen 345 sebelum ini pada November 2020.</p>
<p>Tambahan pula, mereka juga boleh memohon untuk membeli flat setelah mendapat
Keputusan Sementara, dan menyelesaikan isu-isu berkaitan hartanah perkahwinan
dan hak penjagaan anak-anak mereka.</p>
<p>Individu yang membeli flat baharu dengan anak-anak mereka juga boleh layak
untuk beberapa skim seperti Skim Bantuan untuk Pemohon Kali Kedua (ASSIST)
dan Skim Perumahan Sementara Keibubapaan (PPHS).</p>
<p>Selain isu perumahan, kami akan terus menyokong ibu bapa yang bercerai
dan anak-anak mereka melalui langkah-langkah sokongan yang meluas di bawah
Pakej Perkahwinan dan Keibubapaan, supaya mereka dapat terus berkembang
maju seperti keluarga-keluarga lain.</p>
<p>Oleh itu, pasangan yang bercerai tidak perlu risau. Pemerintah akan melakukan
yang terbaik untuk membantu anda.</p>
<p>Encik Faisal juga merujuk kepada Pas Lawatan Jangka Panjang untuk pasangan
warga asing dan berkongsi beberapa kebimbangan, seperti, sama ada pendekatan
yang ada sekarang, iaitu permohonan dan penilaian secara dalam talian,
adalah mencukupi. Kami akan merujuk maklum balas beliau kepada ICA.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker Sir, in English.</p>
<p>To summarise, since the start of this term of Government, despite the
major disruptions brought by COVID, we have kept up a strong supply and
delivered new flats to homebuyers – about 80,000 households would have
collected keys to their new flats between 2020 to 2024. We have continued
to provide affordable housing – about 8 in 10 first-timer families can
service their monthly HDB loan instalments with CPF, with little or no
cash outlay. This remained true in 2024, despite rising housing prices.
And amidst the challenges, our longstanding commitment to supporting the
housing needs and aspirations of Singaporean families remains firm.</p>
<p>I thank Members again for their suggestions on housing. We will continue
to study their ideas and improve our system to support young couples as
they embark on their marriage and parenthood journey.</p>
<p><strong><u>Financial Support for Child-Raising</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For couples deciding whether to have children, the next big consideration
is costs. This is fully understandable as the costs of child-raising can
add up with each subsequent child. Several Members have called for more
financial support for couples. Today, the Government provides a wide range
of financial support for families, through cash payouts, grants, subsidies
and other forms of support.</p>
<p><em>Before birth</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> asked if the Government could support expenses
incurred before the child is born, such as pre-natal checkups. <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong> asked
if we can allow maternity and child-bearing medical fees to be fully claimable
from MediSave without limits.</p>
<p>It was announced in October last year, under the MediSave Maternity Package,
expectant mothers will benefit from an increase in MediSave inpatient and
day surgery withdrawal limits from 1 April this year. For a typical delivery
episode comprising a two-day B2/C class ward stay and related pre-delivery
medical expenses, the amount of MediSave one can withdraw will be up to
$4,280, a more than 50% increase from today. We set a limit because MediSave
is intended to help Singaporeans offset healthcare expenses over their
lifetime, especially during significant health episodes which tend to happen
during old age. MediSave withdrawal limits are therefore set to strike
a careful balance between improving the affordability of current treatment
and ensuring Singaporeans have sufficient savings for their future healthcare
needs.</p>
<p><em>At birth and in the early years</em>
</p>
<p>Upon birth, each Singaporean baby receives a MediSave Grant for Newborns
(MGN), which can be used cover their Medishield Life premiums, hospitalisation
and outpatient treatments. The MGN will be increased from $4,000 to $5,000
for babies born on or after 1 April this year.</p>
<p>Nationally-recommended childhood vaccinations and developmental screenings
at polyclinics, and GP clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme
are also fully subsidised.</p>
<p>In the child’s early years, Government support continues in the form of
the Baby Bonus Scheme, comprising the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and the Child
Development Account. These help parents to defray various child-related
costs, from daily expenses, to preschool and healthcare. Taking the Baby
Bonus Scheme and the increased MGN together, parents can receive up to
$25,000 for their first child, and up to $38,000 for subsequent children.
The Baby Bonus Cash Gift is paid out every year until the child turns six-and-a-half,
providing sustained support over the child’s early years.</p>
<p>The Government also provides strong support for infant care and childcare
as outlined by MOS Sun earlier. <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh </strong>and <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai </strong>suggested
providing subsidies for grandparents who care for young children. We are
mindful that doing so might make such family support overly transactional
and monetise familial relationships. It would be more meaningful for appreciation
for grandparents to come from their children instead. But meanwhile, we
signal our support for the care provided by grandparents through the Grandparent
Caregiver Relief, for working mothers whose parents or grandparents care
for their children aged 12 or below.</p>
<p>Government support continues as our children progress through school.
Education in our national school system and Institutes of Higher Learning
is highly subsidised. In total, every Singaporean child can receive over
$200,000 in education subsidies from preschool through to secondary school.
When you add in the subsidies for higher education – ITE, Polytechnics
and the publicly funded universities – the amount is even higher. Students
from lower to middle-income families may access various financial assistance
schemes offered by the Government, schools and institutions.</p>
<p>For those with more children, we know that expenses for larger families
can add up. As mentioned by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally
last year, we will be introducing a new scheme for large families. Details
will be announced at Budget.</p>
<p><strong><u>Development and Wellbeing of Our Children</u></strong>
</p>
<p>We are also doing more to foster our children’s health, wellbeing and
development.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> suggested providing expecting mothers with
support for each stage of their pregnancy. Last year, we launched the Child
and Maternal Health and Well-being Action Plan for mothers and children,
including initiatives such as mental health screening and antenatal and
postnatal support.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, we launched Family Nexus centres in four neighbourhoods
to bring health and social services closer to families in a single location
within their communities. Services include child developmental assessments,
postnatal support and marriage and parenting workshops. We have served
over 12,000 children and their parents at these sites.</p>
<p><strong><u>Balancing Work and Family Commitments</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The next thing parents that really need is time. Many parents tell us
they value both family and careers. At work, they want to do their best
to fulfill their responsibilities. Yet, they also need to care for their
children, and increasingly their parents and grandparents too.</p>
<p>When it comes to child-raising, fathers need to be involved as well. As <strong>Ms Joan Pereira</strong> and <strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong> highlighted,
research shows that children benefit from fathers’ involvement in their
early years and have positive developmental outcomes well beyond the early
years.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we have strengthened our support in three areas
to give parents more of that precious commodity – time. These include:
Parental leave; Infant care, childcare and student-care facilities which
free up parents’ time and allow them to focus on work; and Flexible Work
Arrangements, or FWAs.</p>
<p>In this term, we have significantly ramped up leave for parents. We doubled
Government-Paid Paternity Leave from two to four weeks; We doubled Unpaid
Infant Care Leave to 12 days per parent per year, in the child’s first
two years. We introduced 10 additional weeks of new Shared Parental Leave
or SPL, with the leave equally allocated between both parents as a default
to encourage shared parental responsibility. These, together with maternity
leave, gives parents of newborns a total of 30 weeks of paid leave. We
are also introducing employment protection for fathers starting from 1
April this year, such that it will be unlawful for employers to dismiss
male employees on paternity leave. At the same time, we understand <strong>Mr Mark Lee</strong>’s
and <strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling</strong>’s concern that employers, especially
SMEs, may incur additional costs when making covering arrangements for
employees on parental leave. To support employers, most of our parental
leave provisions are Government-paid. Employers can use the wage savings
as they deem fit, including to offset any costs during the transition period
between returning employees and covering staff. We encourage parents to
discuss their leave plans with their employers as early as possible and
work with them on suitable covering arrangements.</p>
<p>We have complemented annual leave provisions with Childcare Leave to cater
for ad hoc situations where time off is needed. We provide more childcare
leave to those with younger children, as older children are generally more
independent.</p>
<p>Some Members have called for more Childcare Leave, especially for those
with more children, primary school-aged children, or children with disabilities.
We can understand why families would like additional childcare leave. At
the same time, enhancements to our leave schemes require us to strike a
fine balance between the caregiving needs of these parents and other caregivers,
as well as the needs of employers. Employers also need time to adjust to
the new Shared Parental Leave scheme starting soon, which is more complex
to administer. However, Members can be assured that we will continue to
regularly review our leave policies in consultation with parents and the
Tripartite Partners.</p>
<p>The Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests, which
MOS Gan has spoken about, will benefit all parents with caregiving responsibilities
in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>At the same time, I urge employers to ensure their workplaces are FWA
friendly. Employers should not think of Flexible Work Arrangements as an
inconvenient imposition but rather embrace it as an integral part of the
HR toolkit to attract and retain talent and redesign the way your company
works for greater success.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Louis Chua</strong> suggested that we over-emphasise work over
family, but on the other hand, <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai </strong>and <strong>Ms Hazel Poa </strong>have
reiterated the importance of job security to Singaporeans. This is why
we need to strike a balance and ensure that our policies are considered
and meet the needs of all stakeholders, so the Government actually adopts
the position in between - a balance on both sides. What’s happening in
the US now – the call to everybody to come back to the office and not to
be able to work from home - is really a response and a reaction to the
last few years, where there has been much more working from home. And we
don’t want that kind of backlash here. So that’s why we calibrate things
carefully, recognising that employers’ needs are important, jobs are important,
incomes are important, but also recognising that parents need time to be
with their children. So that is why we take a calibrated approach.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fertility Health</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Nadia</strong> and <strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong> spoke about fertility.
The topic of parenthood cannot be divorced from the subject of fertility.
A key factor affecting fertility is age. With people marrying later or
delaying having children, we need to focus much more on fertility health.</p>
<p>I agree with <strong>Ms Nadia</strong> that the first step is to raise awareness
of factors affecting fertility health.</p>
<p>Second, we need to normalise discussions about fertility health. For those
who want to have children but have not been successful, the topic of infertility
is often shrouded in stigma and shame and for some, a sense of personal
failure. We need to have a broader understanding that infertility can affect
anyone, male or female, and should be approached in a similar manner to
other health issues.</p>
<p>The Government has stepped up fertility support in this term. Eligible
couples can receive subsidies of up to 70% for fertility tests. Those undergoing
Assisted Conception Procedures in public healthcare institutions can receive
up to 75% co-funding. We also introduced Elective Egg Freezing in 2023,
to give women who wish to start a family the option to do so if they marry
later.</p>
<p>I thank <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong>, <strong>Ms Nadia Samdin</strong> and <strong>Ms Hazel Poa </strong>for
their suggestions on this front. Today, women can tap on MediSave for egg
freezing done on medical grounds. We are studying if other financing support
should also be extended to egg freezing done on medical grounds. For those
who wish to use their frozen eggs for Assisted Conception Procedures in
future, they can receive Government co-funding support and use MediSave
for their treatments. I wish to clarify with <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> that
since January 2020, women aged 40 and above can receive co-funding for
up to two of the six co-funded ART cycles, as long as they have attempted
an ART or intrauterine insemination, the IUI, procedure before age 40.</p>
<p>We have also bolstered mental and emotional support for those undergoing
fertility treatment. Assisted Reproduction centres are required to inform
patients of available counselling services prior to any assisted conception
procedure, and refer them for psychosocial counselling if needed.</p>
<p>Non-government groups also have an important role to play. Fertility Support
SG is a non-profit organisation started in 2020 by a group of ladies facing
infertility. They decided to create a community of support for others with
fertility issues. They provide information, create a safe space for discussions
and share experiences.</p>
<p><strong><u>Supporting Marriage</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, much of today’s debate has centred on married couples and
parents. But singles are also an important group to look out for.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> and <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> asked
if the Government could run a networking agency or app for singles to meet
potential partners. I should say that decisions around dating and romantic
relationships are deeply personal. These are certainly not things that
the Government can mandate. What we can do perhaps, is try our best to
facilitate. Introducing a platform or app with an explicit Government signature
may not be the most effective approach. Many youths tell us they prefer
to meet and interact with people in natural settings. Today, we have a
vibrant social interaction space with a wide variety of options for singles
to meet new people, be it through well-established online apps, or more
informal interest groups. We welcome ground-up initiatives by partners
who are keen to encourage and strengthen friendships among young people.
And, we will provide our support where appropriate.</p>
<p><u>Whole-of-Society Support for Families</u>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, support for families goes beyond what Government can do. If
we are to succeed in having more marriages and babies, we will need a whole
of society approach – employers, businesses, community partners and individuals,
all have their part to play too, to create a society where family is valued
and parenthood is supported.</p>
<p>It’s not always the big things. Sometimes it is the small things. <strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> has
made repeated calls in the House for more lactation rooms for nursing mothers.</p>
<p>At his invitation I met with the Breastfeeding Mothers Support Group to
understand the challenges faced by breastfeeding mothers. They shared stories
of how some nursing mothers had to express in a dusty storeroom or spaces
with little privacy. And recently, a former colleague sent me a picture
of what passes for a lactation room in a dispute resolution facility –
basically a room with a table and chairs suitable for meetings but not
really configured for a nursing mother’s needs. We must consider the message
that is inadvertently being sent, which is that breastfeeding (which is
an integral part of motherhood) is an inconvenience and the provision of
facilities for it is more of an afterthought. That’s the message that’s
being sent. So, I’m sure there is no ill-intent on the part of building
owners and employers. But the message to nursing mothers is discouraging
nonetheless and at odds with a society that wants to be supportive of families.</p>
<p>On this, I am pleased to inform <strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> and Members
that BCA has recently released the Draft Code on Accessibility 2025 for
public consultation which, among other things, proposes enhanced requirements
for lactation rooms in office buildings and business parks. Public feedback
has been positive thus far. BCA is refining the proposed revisions, and
I will share more at MND’s COS.</p>
<p>This is just a small example. But the broader point is that as a society,
we must think more deeply and carefully about how we can be supportive
of families in ways big and small. Be it from reimagining how to structure
work and adopt good HR policies to help employees manage career and parenthood,
to having child-friendly infrastructure and activities for families.</p>
<p>In this, Families For Life and the Made For Families which MOS Sun spoke
about play important roles. Families For Life provides information, programmes
and community support on marriage, parenting and grandparenting, which
can also be accessed online. I encourage families to avail themselves of
these resources. Made For Families rallies organisations to adopt family-friendly
practices. To date, more than 280 businesses had pledged their commitment
under the Made For Families movement. However, that is still a very small
number compared to the number of businesses in operation. I therefore encourage
more businesses to join us as partners.</p>
<p>Sir, to summarise, this Government is committed to supporting Singaporeans
along their marriage and parenthood journey. This includes:</p>
<p>For buying their first flat: Grants – up to $120,000 for BTO flats and
up to $230,000 for resale flats; not forgetting the market subsidies that
we provide to keep BTO flats affordable.</p>
<p>It also includes support for raising children: Up to $38,000 in Baby Bonus
and MGN for each child, and over $200,000 in education subsidies per child
from preschool to secondary school, and even more for higher education.</p>
<p>And also work-life support: 30 weeks of paid parental leave during the
child’s first year after birth; and various caregiving options and Flexible
Work Arrangements for ongoing caregiving needs.</p>
<p>For preschools, we have ramped up infant care capacity; and for education,
we have undertaken major reforms.</p>
<p>All in all, factoring in our investments in the early childhood sector
and upcoming parental leave enhancements, we expect marriage and parenthood
initiatives to cost the Government close to $7 billion in FY2026, up from
over $4 billion in 2020. Most of that increase is for the early childhood
sector and the upcoming parental leave enhancements. This is over and above
our subsidies for general and higher education, as well as our housing
subsidies.</p>
<p>So Sir, I support the original Motion. The original motion is “That this
House calls for the continued review and updating of policies to better
support families, as well as the marriage and parenthood aspirations of
Singaporeans, and endorses a whole of society approach to build a Singapore
Made For Families.”</p>
<p><strong>Mr Leong</strong>’s proposed amendment is to delete the words
“continued review and updating”, and substitute instead with the word “reimagination”.
So, if you do that, if you insert his amendment, it will read as follows
“That this House calls for the reimagining of policies to better support
families, as well as the marriage and parenthood aspirations of Singaporeans,
and endorses a whole of society approach to build a Singapore Made For
Families”.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Mr Speaker, I would have no issue with such a proposed amendment,
because after all why would one object to the idea of reimagining something
and making sure that you can come up with something new? Except that in
this context, there are two reasons why I would not support the amendment.</p>
<p>The first is that, in this context, it is actually not a step forward.
It is a step back. And second, it is tied to a policy which is problematic.</p>
<p>The first reason why I say that the amendment is actually a step back
is because, in this debate, I think <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>, <strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong>,
and <strong>Mr Louis Chua</strong>, have sought to portray the marriage
and parenthood measures that we have at the moment as incremental. So,
in other words, not bold enough, not doing enough, therefore you need to
reimagine something. But the point is this, in the last few years, we have
already started the reimagination process – it’s called Forward SG.</p>
<p>Then-DPM Lawrence Wong said at the launch of the Forward Singapore exercise
in June 2022, that the 4G team was going to “embark on an exercise to review
and refresh our social compact, and chart a roadmap for the next decade
and beyond."</p>
<p>And just before he became PM, he said in an interview with local media,
“We are prepared to relook everything. It is not so much that we are going
to slay a sacred cow for the sake of doing so. But we are prepared to re-examine
all our assumptions and consider, under different circumstances, different
societal expectations and needs - how might we do things differently? And
we have already started this process because the Forward SG work has already
started."</p>
<p>So, what are the some of the major moves that we have done? We have done
quite a few things. If you think about it, the HDB new classification framework,
that is a major move. For decades, we have had the Mature and Non-Mature
classification. But this came out of Forward SG. We launched it last year
and this is just starting to take place, and we are rolling it out. So,
it is actually being implemented.</p>
<p>The other major move would be for preschool. We have enhanced access to
affordable quality preschool, we have ramped up the infant care capacity
three-fold over the last ten years, and by the end of this year, we will
achieve our commitment to provide Government-supported places to cater
for 80% of preschoolers. We also lowered the out-of-pocket expenses, and
we have had subsidy enhancements and fee cap reductions.</p>
<p>For education, we have made big bold changes in education under the ‘Equip’
pillar of Forward SG. We have removed the PSLE T-score, we have removed
mid-year exams, we now have full implementation of Full Subject-Based Banding,
and we have broadened the post-secondary pathways.</p>
<p>In addition, we have got the Shared Parental Leave. That is another major
move – ten weeks of Government paid leave, which is going to cost us something
to the tune of $400 million per year. This was under the ‘Care’ pillar
of Forward SG. And also for the Flexible Work Arrangements, we introduced
the Tripartite Guidelines. All these are major moves with the vision of
a Singapore Made For Families.</p>
<p>So, we have already started the reimagination process. The boat called
“Reimagination” has already left the port and is sailing. It is heading
out towards open waters, it is chugging along, it is picking up speed and
we are implementing, adding on and enhancing as we go.</p>
<p>Thus, to ask us in this amendment to start reimagination is kind of like
a step back. It is kind of like going to the port, whereas the ship has
already sailed. That is the reason why I cannot agree to the amendment
and that is the first reason.</p>
<p>But there is a second reason which I consider problematic. That is because,
in his speech on calling for reimagination, <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai </strong>has
also said that we need to adopt certain policies. And one of the central
ones is the Affordable Homes Scheme.</p>
<p>I mean the other ideas and suggestions, certainly we can think about and
explore. But the Affordable Homes Scheme is the one that removes the price
of land when pricing flats upfront, and that is problematic. Because PSP’s
Affordable Homes Scheme is akin to a prepaid rental scheme, that turns
Singaporeans from homeowners to tenants, and users only have the option
to buy the flat at the point when they are actually going to sell it. And
that is a raid on the reserves. And so, for that reason, in the context
of this amendment, reimagination entails certain policies put forth by
PSP of which a key one is the Affordable Homes Scheme, which constitutes,
amongst other things, a raid on the reserves, and I cannot support it.</p>
<p>But Sir, other than that, I really do thank Members for their support
for families, their ideas, suggestions which we will continue to take onboard.
And I support the original motion. Thank you.</p>
