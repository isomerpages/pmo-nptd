<p>Pro Bono SG Chairman, Mr Gregory Vijayendran</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>
<br>Good afternoon. It is wonderful to see efforts from the community to deliver
care for families who might require assistance. I am glad Pro Bono SG and
South Central Community Family Service Centre have launched the Transnational
Family Care Programme, which will provide support for transnational families
and foreign spouses who are in need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, about one-third of citizen marriages involved a Singapore
citizen marrying a non-citizen. That is not surprising given that Singapore
is a global city, and our citizens often meet and interact with those from
other countries. Some of them eventually become their significant other
and spouses. Among these foreign spouses, some may have grown up here or
have been working in Singapore for some time. Others may be newcomers to
Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These families add to the diversity of our population. They have made
Singapore their home and are contributing to our society. Many of them
have children who are Singapore citizens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Transnational families are not a new feature to our society, but what’s
new is the numbers. They are growing. They could be our relatives, our
friends, our neighbours, or even our own families. As Singaporeans, all
of us play a role in welcoming these new members of Singapore families
and supporting them to integrate into our society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the national-level, the Government supports Singaporeans in starting
and raising families and forge a strong Singaporean citizenry – this includes
targeted grants and subsidies to ensure that housing, preschool and education,
and healthcare remain accessible and affordable for all Singaporean families.
But there are challenges which are unique to transnational families, such
as cultural integration and emotional support, especially for those who
are new to Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Government works with the community partners to help transnational
couples build a strong foundation for their marriages and better integrate
into our society. For example, there are Transnational Family Support Programmes,
such as the Marriage Preparation Programme, Marriage Support Programme,
and Friendship Programme, provided by the Ministry of Social and Family
Development’s partners to help foreign spouses adapt to Singapore, and
importantly to ensure marriages are strong. Because if the marriages are
strong, they will have less need for help and social assistance.</p>
<p>But there are some groups of foreign spouses who require more assistance.
For instance, some foreign spouses undergoing divorce proceedings may not
be able to afford their own lawyers. They may require legal assistance,
along with other social support suitable for their unique and challenging
circumstances. When I was at Ministry of Law, I would speak to the judges
and the judges will also tell me that they could deal with the legal parts,
but they couldn’t deal with the social parts. You need to have a place
where they can integrate and bring the different strands together. This
Transnational Family Care Programme will fulfil that role.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Community partners play an important role in supporting such groups in
need. This new Transnational Family Care Programme is a good example of
how community partners can enrich our support ecosystem. Through their
close ties with the community, they are agile in responding to emerging
needs. They can pool expertise and resources, and guide their beneficiaries
with their extensive ground experience and insights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Transnational Family Care programme fills the gap for transnational
families who require a holistic socio-legal support but do not qualify
for national legal aid schemes. We all heard how important having legal
advice, knowing how to navigate the legal system or just knowing the law
is, and this is why this is such an important programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, the South Central Community Family Service Centre hosts “The Inclusive
Fund”, an initiative which provides healthcare, education and support to
transnational families who do not get enough formal support for various
reasons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under the new “Transnational Family Care” programme, Pro Bono SG’s community
lawyers will be deployed to the South Central Community Family Service
Centre, to provide legal guidance and representation to transnational families
in need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pro Bono SG and South Central Community Family Service Centre will work
closely with other community partners like Family Service Centres, to get
these families the holistic support they need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I applaud and support these efforts, and I thank Pro Bono SG and their
partners for extending help to these families in need. Just two years ago,
Pro Bono SG launched the Family Justice Support Scheme, which provides
pro bono representation for matrimonial matters to foreign spouses with
Singaporean children. All these efforts add up. Such partnerships between
community partners are essential in creating a cohesive and inclusive society
where every individual has the opportunity to thrive. We want the children
in transnational families to do well, so they can support their parents
and they themselves will be able to realise their own potential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To conclude, the Government will continue to support and work closely
with community partners and organisations to provide assistance to those
among us who need help. As a society, we need everyone to work together
to uplift and support the lives of the people around us. I look forward
to more community efforts as we navigate a changing world together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
