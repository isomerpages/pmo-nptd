<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As DPM indicated earlier, our preliminary resident TFR for 2025 was 0.87,
lower than 0.97 in 2024. It is our lowest TFR to date. Resident births
across all ethnic groups decreased, with the decrease in Chinese births
being proportionately larger, at a drop of 15% compared to 2024. This is
due in part to the typical post-Dragon Year decrease.</p>
<p>The declining TFR means our citizen population growth has slowed. This
is an existential challenge for us.</p>
<p>Trying to raise our TFR has always been a priority but with the latest
figures, this has acquired a new urgency. The Government is wholly committed
to addressing this issue head on and we will spare no effort to arrest
and reverse this decline. However, this cannot be the work of Government
alone. We need all of society to play their part.</p>
<p>To ensure that our plans are targeted and effective, we must first understand
the drivers and factors that are inhibiting marriage and family formation.</p>
<p><strong><u>Falling TFR – A Global Issue</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Declining TFR is not an issue unique to just Singapore. It is a global
phenomenon. All over the world, more people are choosing to remain single
or marry later, and those who marry are choosing to have fewer or no children
at all.</p>
<p>As PM pointed out earlier today, this issue is not simply economic. Some
countries have spent a lot on a whole range of support schemes. Others
provide very generous welfare systems. These measures can help at the margins.
But they have not fundamentally reversed the trend.</p>
<p>Countries like France and the Nordic countries, which have long been held
up as exemplars of higher TFR, continue to see declines in their birth
rates. In China, the number of deaths now exceed the number of births.
Even in the region, the TFRs of Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are on the
downtrend. South Korea, which currently has the world’s lowest TFR, recently
saw an increase in marriages and births. This could be due in part to the
large cohort of children born to South Korea’s Baby Boomers who are now
entering childbearing age. It remains to be seen if their recent more family-friendly
policies will have a lasting impact. However, it still gives us hope that
fertility trends could shift and sustained efforts across multiple fronts
may yield results over time.</p>
<p>But what is really striking is if you look at the TFR of cities. As a
city-state, Singapore's TFR may be more comparable to that of other metropolitan
cities rather than other countries. In fact, the TFR of major cities tend
to be much lower than their countries’ overall TFR. In 2024:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>France’s TFR was 1.62 but Paris’s was 1.27.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japan’s TFR was 1.15 but Tokyo’s was 0.96.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China’s TFR was around 1.00 but Hong Kong’s was 0.84 and Shanghai’s was
less than 0.8.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Without over-generalising, cities typically have a faster, more intense
pace of life, and greater competition and stress. As a small city-state,
Singapore experiences these effects more acutely. This is reflected in
our Marriage and Parenthood surveys, where besides financial cost, other
concerns such as the stress of raising children and difficulties in managing
work and family demands are the most common reasons cited by married respondents
when considering whether to have children. But there are other factors
at play too.</p>
<p>To unpack this further, I engaged various groups of Singaporeans at different
life stages to hear their thoughts on this issue. Today, and today I would
like to share with you what I learnt from them.</p>
<p><strong><u>First, there are the singles</u></strong>. The Millennials
and Gen Zs shared that dating, and marriage often took a backseat to their
many other interests and goals. Some wanted to establish themselves in
their careers before seeking a life partner. Others were looking for the
right marriage partner but had yet to find the right person. Many shared
they were looking for deeper and more meaningful connections but sometimes
had difficulty meeting others and forging authentic in-person relationships
after leaving school and entering the workforce.</p>
<p><strong><u>Next, there were those who are married but hesitant to have children.</u></strong> This
group felt anxious about becoming parents. They were worried about not
being able to live up to the expectations of being a good parent. Some
feared that having children meant trading off their careers and other life
goals. Others were concerned about the financial, emotional and mental
demands of parenthood. And some women were anxious about how they would
cope with the physical and emotional changes that come with pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong><u>Next, there were the married, want children but have fertility issues.</u></strong> On
the flip side, these were married couples who very much wanted children
but were unable to conceive. They spoke candidly about the challenges encountered
in their fertility journey, including only realising the problem very late,
not knowing where to get help, the fear of stigma, limited workplace support
and difficulty in getting time off for fertility treatments, and the cost
of fertility treatments.</p>
<p><strong><u>Then we have the parents with young children.</u></strong> Without
exception, everyone in this group spoke about the joy their children had
brought to their lives. They did not sugarcoat the challenges and sacrifices
of parenthood but when they weighed these against the love and happiness
they experienced, they were glad they had chosen to have children. However,
they also expressed their hope for more support for families, and better
balance between work and family responsibilities. This was especially so
for those caring for both young children and ageing parents.</p>
<p><strong><u>A Marriage and Parenthood Reset</u></strong>
</p>
<p>If we are to change our trajectory, these are the issues we must tackle.
They cannot be addressed by policy measures alone. What we need is a Marriage
and Parenthood Reset – by which I mean a reset across society on the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How marriage and parenthood are viewed and supported;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, how workplaces can evolve to better align work and family; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, how everyone can play their part.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, we will form a new Workgroup with the relevant agencies
to look into these issues holistically, and engage widely across members
of the public, businesses and the people sector. I will chair this Workgroup
and will share more details in due course.</p>
<p>But for now, let me set out the broad 4-pronged approach that we will
take:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First, we will build on current efforts to enhance government support
for marriage and parenthood;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we will cultivate positive mindsets about marriage and parenthood;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, we will work with employers to foster workplace cultures and practices
that are family friendly; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth, we will engage the whole of society in this effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Building On Current Efforts</u></strong>
</p>
<p>On the first one, the Government will build on current efforts to enhance
support for marriage and parenthood. In recent years, we have significantly
enhanced our Marriage and Parenthood Package. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Enhanced Baby Bonus Scheme and MediSave Grant for Newborns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doubling Paternity Leave and making it mandatory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new 10-week Shared Parental Leave (SPL);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Large Families Scheme (LFS); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year, we will provide another $500 of Child LifeSG Credits for every
Singaporean child aged 12 and below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward we will do more.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Shawn Loh, Mr Andre Low and Ms Hany Soh</strong> raised concerns
and gave suggestions about the costs of raising children. <strong>The Government is committed to helping parents with the cost of child-raising.</strong> Four
years ago, parents received up to $32,000 per child under the Baby Bonus
Scheme and MediSave Grant for Newborns. Today, with the addition of the
Large Families Scheme, it is up to $54,000 per child. On the education
front, every Singaporean child can receive over $200,000 in subsidies from
preschool through to secondary school. We will look into enhancing this
further and consider the different ideas that Members have suggested.</p>
<p><strong>On housing,</strong> as<strong> Mr David Hoe</strong> raised in
his Budget Debate speech and as <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> highlighted,
we will enable couples who are ready to build a life together to secure
and afford their own home.</p>
<p>We are increasing the supply of Build-To-Order or BTO flats, with more
shorter waiting time or SWT flats so couples and young families can get
their flats more quickly. MND has also reviewed how it can better support
growing families who may need more space, and we will share more at the
MND COS.</p>
<p><strong>For preschool and caregiving</strong>, MSF has progressively lowered
fee caps at Government-supported preschools and expanded preschool places.
These moves have improved accessibility and affordability.</p>
<p>In Budget 2026, PM announced that the income thresholds for preschool
and student care subsidies will be revised so more families can benefit.
Government agencies are also undertaking a review of the student care sector
to better meet the caregiving needs of families with primary school-aged
children.</p>
<p><strong>On work-life support</strong>, while take-up rates for the new
Shared Parental Leave scheme are not yet available, initial feedback from
parents has been positive. They appreciate being able to spend more time
with their newborns. Some said this has encouraged them to consider having
another child.</p>
<p>But we know that beyond infancy, parents require additional time-off from
work to care for their children. Many parents and Members in this House
like <strong>Ms Valerie Lee </strong>and <strong>Mr David Hoe h</strong>ave
asked for more childcare leave. <strong>Ms Lee Hui Ying</strong> also asked
how we can better support the sandwich generation who are caring for their
children as well as their ageing parents or other family dependents.</p>
<p>We will study the childcare leave suggestions carefully, bearing in mind
the needs of employers, who are still adjusting to the recent parental
leave enhancements.</p>
<p>Even without any legislated requirement, many progressive employers have
stepped up to introduce caregiving-related leave provisions, as part of
their strategy to attract and retain talent, such as adopting the Tripartite
Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. Beyond leave, Flexible
Work Arrangements or FWAs are another sustainable way to provide employees
with greater flexibility in meeting their diverse caregiving needs.</p>
<p>We also want to better support parents as they re-enter the workforce
after taking a career break, as <strong>Mr Mark Lee </strong>and<strong> Ms Elysa Chen </strong>highlighted.</p>
<p>Today, these parents can tap on broad-based employment facilitation and
skills training as well as career guidance programmes, such as the Workforce
Singapore’s Mid-Career Pathways Programme and Career Conversion Programmes,
to gain industry-relevant skills and support their transition into suitable
job roles.</p>
<p>The Government is also helping companies redesign jobs through initiatives
like the Enterprise Workforce Transformation Package. Such support can
help lower the barrier of re-entry for caregivers who wish to return to
the workforce, by helping companies strengthen organisational capability
to offer more adaptable workforce models, including various forms of FWAs
for employees. MOM is also reviewing how we can better support job fractionalisation
under the Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. Having more fractionalised
jobs will be helpful to parents seeking part-time work.</p>
<p>Another important area spoken about is<strong> fertility health</strong>,
as highlighted by several Members earlier. Later marriages and births are
becoming more common. In 2024, the median age of mothers at first birth
was around 32 years old. As both male and female fertility declines with
age, more couples may face fertility challenges. Today, about 1 in 6 people
globally experience infertility<sup>.1</sup>
</p>
<p>Many don’t know where to seek help or are fearful of stigma attached to
doing so.</p>
<p>To help those with fertility issues we will work with other agencies to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raise awareness of fertility health, including improving accessibility
of information on existing support, encouraging fertility checks, and normalising
the seeking of medical attention to fertility issues. Those in need can
refer to the Made For Families website<sup>2</sup> for current support measures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the financial and non-financial support couples receive throughout
their fertility journeys; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with employers to improve workplace support for employees undergoing
fertility treatments. For a start, I encourage employers and HR departments
to refer to the Workplace Fertility Support Guide produced by Fertility
Support SG<sup>3</sup>, which <strong>Ms Cassandra Lee </strong>highlighted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On <strong>Ms Valerie Lee’s </strong>suggestion on support through miscarriages,
psychosocial support like counselling is available in public healthcare
institutions. And We agree that more can be done, and will study her suggestions
to see how we can better support those who experienced miscarriages. On <strong>Ms Elysa Chen’s </strong>suggestion
to enhance postpartum support for parents, there are ongoing initiatives
at the public maternity hospitals and polyclinics to provide perinatal
and postpartum support, such as scheduled telephone check-ins and follow-ups
post-discharge. Mothers who require breastfeeding and lactation support
can tap on services offered in polyclinics, such as the Breastfeeding Triple
Support @NUHS polyclinics. They can also visit Family Nexus sites to find
out more about parent-child bonding programmes and parenting support services.
To identify women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus for timely management,
the Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) has also updated the ACE Clinical
Guideline to help healthcare professionals to assess the onset of pre-diabetes
or diabetes post-partum.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Foo Cexiang</strong> also highlighted in his Budget Debate speech
the need to better support adoptive parents. Today, adoptive parents receive
benefits like biological parents, such as parental leave provisions. Nonetheless,
we recognise that more can be done to improve and streamline the adoption
processes and we will work with agencies to look into this.</p>
<p>The areas I just shared are part of the Government’s broader efforts to
better support Singaporeans through their marriage and parenthood journey.
Besides consultations that the Workgroup will have with members of the
public, businesses and the people sector, we will also enhance our Marriage
and Parenthood Survey this year to gain deeper insights on how attitudes
and perceptions towards marriage and parenthood have evolved. The feedback
and suggestions will inform the Workgroup’s recommendations and shape the
next bound of marriage and parenthood enhancements.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cultivating Positive Mindsets about Marriage &amp; Parenthood</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Next, we will <strong>cultivate positive mindsets towards marriage and parenthood.</strong>
</p>
<p>Decisions on whether to get married and start a family are deeply personal.
And as we have found in our engagements, mindsets matter a great deal when
making these decisions.</p>
<p>When we say we want to change mindsets, it is not about pushing a single
“correct” path. Rather, as<strong> Ms Nadia Samdin </strong>shared, it
is about creating an environment where decisions surrounding marriage and
parenthood can be viewed optimistically and positively, rather than with
fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>Mindset change has many aspects. But let me touch on two.</p>
<p><strong>Mindset #1: That Parenthood Represents a Net Loss</strong>
</p>
<p>There was a marked difference in mindsets between those who were still
weighing whether or not to have children and those who had already decided
to have children. Those who were hesitant looked at parenthood through
the lens of what they might lose – being held back in their careers, inability
to pursue other life goals, and loss of personal freedom. Those with children
or intending to have them, on the other hand, saw parenthood in terms of
what they gained – the joy of family, and the fulfilment and personal growth
that come with being parents.</p>
<p>In reality, finding a life partner, getting married and starting a family
are major milestones that require time, energy, and change. It is understandable
and rightfully so, that entering into these commitments should be carefully
considered. However, many Singaporean couples have demonstrated that having
family and careers can co-exist alongside other life goals.</p>
<p>Parenthood does take real effort and commitment, and while there will
inevitably be compromises along the way, what is gained in terms of family
relationships, love and fulfilment is both precious and priceless. We hope
that as many Singaporeans as possible can experience the joys of marriage
and parenthood. Ultimately it is a personal choice. But we need a mindset
change, to encourage couples to consider a more balanced picture when exercising
this choice.</p>
<p><strong>Mindset #2. Perfect Parenting and the Education Arms Race</strong>
</p>
<p>In our engagements, another prevailing mindset was the immense pressure
couples put on themselves to be “the perfect parent”. One young father,
a doctor, felt guilty that he could not spend more time with his son because
of his work schedule. He felt he was not being a good father. Another young
woman, newly-wed, was hesitant to have a child because she was not sure
if she could provide the best possible resources to ensure that her child
would succeed in life.</p>
<p>Wanting more time to spend with your children or providing them with the
right resources stem from good intentions. However, in hindsight, many
parents reflected that parenthood was not about providing the best for
their children or having all the answers right from the very start. Rather,
it was about being willing to learn, adapt and grow alongside their children,
doing the best they can within their circumstances, and relying on community
support where possible, as <strong>Ms Nadia Samdin </strong>noted.</p>
<p>For instance, the Families for Life Parents Telegram groups have enabled
thriving online communities of parents within each local town. Through
these local networks, parents can connect and exchange parenting tips,
share about local family events, and exchange pre-loved items, with other
parents in the community to help them better navigate parenting challenges.</p>
<p>Practical resources and programmes to support families on their parenting
journey from birth to growing through adolescence are also available on
platforms, including HPB’s Parent Hub, the Parenting For Wellness Toolbox,
parenting resources in MOE’s Parent’s Gateway and the Families for Life
Parenting website. We will work with various agencies and partners to regularly
update and refine the resources on the platforms, to ensure they meet parents’
evolving needs.</p>
<p>This pressure to be the perfect parent is perhaps most evident in the
child’s education. Many parents feel pressure to help their children excel
academically, for fear that they may otherwise not succeed in life. They
worry about coaching their children for major exams, or finding the financial
means to send their children to private tuition and enrichment programmes.
If they are unable to do so, they feel that they have fallen short as parents.</p>
<p>I understand that this pressure largely stems from the fear that there
is only a narrow gate to success and if their children do not make it through
that gate, they will have poor life outcomes. These are real anxieties
that we want to help address.</p>
<p>To cater to students’ varied abilities and talents and help our children
develop more holistically, MOE has been making progressive changes over
the years to develop multiple pathways. MOE has also made multiple shifts
to reduce over-emphasis on academic results. MOE will also conduct a series
of Education Conversations with students, parents, educators, researchers,
and academics to explore ways to mitigate the education “arms race”, including
by reducing the stakes of examinations.</p>
<p>But these structural reforms will only work if cultural attitudes towards
competition and success shift in tandem. We must move away from viewing
education in Singapore as a competition for limited prizes and instead
see it as an open highway with many lanes and many different prizes suited
to each child’s unique talents and abilities.</p>
<p>Parents who have high expectations of their children's academic performance
may urge them to achieve good grades or over-react when they fall short
of expectations, but such actions may cause unintended consequences, as
a National University of Singapore study found in 2016. Children with intrusive
parents tended to be overly critical of themselves and were at increased
risk of developing depression and anxiety symptoms. Such pressure can therefore
be detrimental to the child’s well-being.</p>
<p>Some competition and stress is natural but we should do our best to remove
unrealistic expectations or social pressures which add unnecessary stress
on parenthood.</p>
<p><strong><u>Working with employers to foster family-friendly workplaces</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Third, we will work with employers to foster family-friendly workplace cultures and practices.</strong>
</p>
<p>As<strong> Ms Yeo Wan Ling</strong> noted, one of the top stressors for
parents is trying to achieve a balance between work and family responsibilities.
One parent described how frequent work travel made it difficult for her
to be there for her children in their formative years. But not travelling
would affect her career; Some found it difficult to request for Flexible
Work Arrangements, despite the Tripartite Guidelines; Others related having
to choose between being present for important meetings or their child’s
key milestones, and difficulty in leaving work on time to pick their children
up from childcare. Despite the mandatory leave provisions we have introduced
and employment protections, we still hear anecdotes of how some employees
are subtly discouraged from taking leave or how female employees are nudged
to resign once they are pregnant.</p>
<p>We fully recognise that employers have business objectives and financial
bottom lines to meet. However, there is much more we can do to build progressive
workplace cultures to align business priorities with family-friendly practices.</p>
<p>Having supportive employers and workplaces makes a big difference to parents.
But being a family-friendly workplace is not just good for employees, it
also makes good business sense. When people feel supported at work, they
are more motivated, more engaged and more likely to stay.</p>
<p>An example is Mr Edmund Seah, whose employer allowed him to take his paternity
leave in weekly blocks. Edmund took two weeks during his child’s first
month to support his wife’s confinement and took the remaining two weeks
of paternity leave together with his three weeks of Shared Parental Leave.
This flexibility allowed him to be present for his wife and baby when it
mattered. Having benefitted from this flexibility, Mr Seah has paid it
forward by covering his colleague’s workload when she went on maternity
leave.</p>
<p>There was also a Straits Times article last month on Hsinchu City in Taiwan.
It houses Hsinchu Science Park and is often known as the Silicon Valley
of Taiwan. While Taiwan’s TFR is projected to have fallen below 0.8 in
2025, Hsinchu’s has stayed stable at 1.0 for several years. Experts attribute
the higher birth rates to more family-friendly benefits provided by employers,
rather than the Government, to attract and retain the best employees in
a competitive environment. These include hybrid work arrangements, on-site
babycare, baby bonuses and hampers for employees with newborns. This sends
a strong signal that having children is supported and encouraged, and will
not be negative for one’s career.</p>
<p>There are many other ways in which employers can be supportive, such as
providing lactation rooms for nursing mothers, instituting systematic covering
arrangements when an employee has to take time-off, and holding regular
dialogues with employees on how the workplace can be improved. I fully
agree with <strong>Ms Cassandra Lee </strong>on the importance of investing
in HR as they shape workplace norms and culture, and support the last-mile
implementation of family-friendly workplace practices, so that employees
can feel safe and supported to use these provisions. The IHRP Body of Competencies
already includes a key component of holistic well-being which entails HR’s
ability to drive best practices that support employees to thrive, such
as the design of flexible work options and family-related leave.</p>
<p><strong>We want a family-friendly workplace culture to become part of the DNA of all local companies. It should also be a shared responsibility – from senior management and HR managers, to line managers, co-workers and parent-employees themselves.</strong>
</p>
<p>We will continue to review ways to foster workplace cultures and societal
norms that value and support families, including<strong> Mr Haresh Singaraju’s</strong> suggestion
of piloting a tiered workplace certification.</p>
<p><strong><u>Engaging the Whole of Society</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond workplaces, we will encourage neighbourhoods, communities, and
businesses to be supportive of families. There are ground-up efforts to
create conducive community spaces for families. The Caterpillar Library
at the Taman Jurong Community Club established by the Ong family is one
such example, where residents donate a book for every book they take. Starting
out with just 100 books, the Caterpillar Library has now facilitated the
circulation of over 10,000 books, creating connections between neighbours
while helping children discover the joy of reading. I encourage more neighbourhoods
to create such family-friendly spaces. Community organisations and businesses
also contribute by organising a wide range of activities – from the arts
to sports – for families. The Families for Life website provides a list
of such resources for families, and most of the activities are free or
charge nominal fees. In addition, Families for Life has gathered corporate
partners like GetGo, Sofitel Singapore Sentosa and ABC Cooking Studio to
offer Large Families Deals with exclusive discounts and offers. I encourage
more partners to come onboard to celebrate families.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, in conclusion, the latest TFR figures have not deterred us
from our quest to boost marriage and parenthood. If anything, it underscores
the urgency of the task before us, and has made us even more determined
to turn things around. The Government will redouble our efforts to address
this existential challenge.</p>
<p>However, to buck the trend, everyone – parents, employers, businesses
and community partners – needs to be part of this endeavour. In the months
ahead, we will work with stakeholders to develop concrete plans for the
4-pronged approach I laid out earlier. We welcome all suggestions and fresh
ideas on how we can better support Singaporeans’ marriage and parenthood
aspirations. Thank you.</p>
