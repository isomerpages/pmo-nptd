<p>Good morning, everyone. It is such a pleasure to be here and to see so
many friends of Fertility Support SG (FSS). I was very excited when I was
asked to attend this event because it is something that I have long felt
passionate about. At the National Population and Talent Division in Strategy
Group, Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, we coordinate marriage and parenthood issues.
For the majority of couples, marriage and parenthood come fairly easy.
But there is a group where fertility and having children is more difficult.
And for them, it is very important that they have support. FSS fills that
space. So, it is really great to be here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fertility issues are not uncommon in Singapore. One of the main factors
of infertility is age. As we already know, fertility declines with age
for both men and women. Many Singaporeans, like other young people around
the world, may choose to prioritise personal goals such as building a successful
career or pursuing a passion, ahead of getting married and having children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When a couple finally decides that they wish to start a family, they may
find that they have difficulty conceiving. Fertility health issues can
have a deep, emotional impact on couples and families, as I have heard
from the earlier sharing, and they may struggle with the grief and disappointment
of being unable to build the family that they so desperately want.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Infertility can affect any of us, and so it is important to start and
normalise discussions about fertility health, and it is not something that
we are used to doing in a traditional Asian society. But I think it is
time we start these conversations. Today, we are fortunate to have three
couples in the dialogue session who will be sharing about their personal
journeys through infertility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>FSS has been working to create a safe space to have these discussions.
That is really important because when you are sharing, you are opening
up, and you are telling other people about some of the deepest emotional
feelings that you have had. Some of these journeys are difficult, so it
is very important that you have a safe space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recently, they have taken on the management of charity organisation I
Love Children, which is also one of our Made For Families partners. We
are thankful for the work of community partners like FSS in reaching out
and encouraging young couples to seek help early. And it is not just about
seeking help. Awareness is important as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the part of the Government, we are committed to supporting those who
wish to start and build their families, but struggle with fertility health.
Financial support such as co-funding for Assisted Conception Procedures
(ACPs) is available in public healthcare institutions. After co-funding
and MediSave usage for the first ACP cycle, eight in 10 eligible Singapore
Citizen (SC) couples would incur no out-of-pocket expense.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond financial support, couples undergoing their IVF journey may need
psychosocial support, as the journey can be emotionally stressful. Last
year, MOH introduced regulatory requirements mandating Assisted Reproduction
(AR) centres to offer psychosocial counseling to patients prior to any
AR procedure, and to refer the patients for psychosocial counselling if
assessed to be required at any point during the treatment. This is to help
couples be mentally and emotionally prepared for the AR procedure. When
I talk to employers about Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs), we are urging
employers to be more understanding, to know that it is not just for the
women who may be undergoing the treatment, but also to allow time-off for
the husbands because they need to be there to support their wives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will continue to work with partners such as Fertility Support SG to
raise awareness amongst young couples and individuals about fertility health
and consider how we can better support those who are trying to conceive.
So if you have ideas, thoughts, or suggestions, please let us know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With your help, we can build a Singapore that is Made For Families. Thank
you.</p>
