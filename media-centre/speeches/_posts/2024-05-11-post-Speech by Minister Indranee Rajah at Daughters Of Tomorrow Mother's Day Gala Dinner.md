<p>Distinguished guests
<br>Partners of Daughters of Tomorrow
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be here with you at this gala dinner.</p>
<p>On the eve of Mother’s Day, we gather to honour and celebrate remarkable
mothers, two of whom we saw just now. Let us give them a big hand.</p>
<p>Mothers are role models to their children and the wider community, demonstrating
core family values of love, care, concern and commitment, all of which
are values that contribute to the foundation of a strong and compassionate
society. Mothers juggle multiple roles and responsibilities, often sacrificing
their own welfare for the well-being of their children and families. Tonight,
we recognise the resilience of these strong women and celebrate the milestones
of motherhood.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore’s Social Compact</strong>
</p>
<p>The Forward Singapore exercise was launched two years ago with the aim
to refresh and strengthen our social compact – the glue that holds our
society together and our shared values and aspirations as a people. One
key chapter of Forward Singapore is to empower those in need.</p>
<p>The Government has been doing more to support disadvantaged and vulnerable
groups and will continue to do so. We will do more to provide equal opportunities
to uplift lower-income families, and shift our approach from social assistance
to social empowerment. This requires a collective effort by all of us –
the Government, professionals, corporates, community groups, families,
and individuals.</p>
<p>With ComLink+, we are moving beyond episodic short-term assistance to
providing longer-term support where family coaches co-develop action plans
with families, and coach and motivate them towards achieving their goals
and aspirations. Through community partnerships, ComLink+ families that
work with their family coaches can also receive support from volunteer
befrienders and ComLink+ programmes run by social service agencies. They
can also receive financial top-ups under the ComLink+ Progress Packages
to help accelerate their progress, if they take active steps towards their
goals.</p>
<p>The role of the community in this shift towards social empowerment is
key and the good work done by our social service agencies like DOT are
integral to Singapore’s social fabric. Over the last 10 years, DOT spearheaded
multiple initiatives that facilitate livelihood opportunities for thousands
of women and mothers from lower-income families. For example, some ComLink+
families benefited from DOT’s career preparation programme and skills preparation
workshops. This supports them in achieving financial independence and enabling
upward social mobility for their families.</p>
<p><strong>Support for Stable Employment</strong>
</p>
<p>Mothers make up over 80% of the community that DOT serves, and many of
them are constrained by challenges and circumstances that limit their employment
potential. One of DOT’s most important work is the provision of employment
support, forged through partnerships at multiple levels. Last year alone,
DOT helped 149 women secure employment. Close to 60 percent of these women
stayed employed for more than 6 months, marking a significant milestone
in their journey towards stable employment and financial stability.</p>
<p>I am heartened by DOT’s efforts and successes in working with numerous
employers to provide job opportunities with CPF contributions, and that
is very important because you can use that towards home ownership. Many
of these partners are here with us tonight, and I want to thank the partners
for giving these job opportunities. Such community efforts complement Government
efforts such as the ComLink+ Package for Employment, which will encourage
adults in ComLink+ families to secure and sustain employment. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Support for Childcare</strong>
</p>
<p>To meet the needs of these working mothers, in 2018, DOT introduced a
pilot home-based childminding programme in Punggol and Bedok. A 28-year-old
mother of two young children was previously unemployed due to caregiving
duties. When she re-entered the workforce, the home-based childminding
programme allowed her to tap on affordable childminding that catered to
her shift working hours or on days when childcare centres were closed or
when her children were unwell. The mother was also able to take on additional
shifts, and more importantly, complete her skills training to obtain the
Workforce Skills Qualification in Patient Service. Since October 2023,
she secured stable employment as a Patient Service Associate with a 70%
salary increase from her previous full-time job.</p>
<p>I want to commend DOT’s efforts in this. The pilot programme has not only
helped many working mothers, it has also been beneficial to their children’s
psychosocial development as they can now be engaged in meaningful activities
with the childminders. In 2023, the programme expanded its services island
wide, allowing more families to benefit from this support.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>DOT remains committed to supporting mothers in their journey towards financial
independence for themselves and their families. In 2024, DOT aims for 70
percent of their women to secure employment for at least six months, with
20 percent of them earning wages of $2,900 and above. Looking across the
ballroom, I believe this can be achieved with the support from everyone
here tonight.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all corporate and community partners for your important
work and support in this space. Please give yourselves a big hand.</p>
<p>We look forward to the continued partnership to help working women from
lower-income families live connected and productive lives.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to once again congratulate DOT women and all
mothers for their unwavering perseverance, resilience, and dedication towards
their families.</p>
<p>This year's theme for International Women’s Day is “Inspire Inclusion”.
Women in Singapore deserve equal inclusion in our society and workforce,
regardless of backgrounds. I urge everyone to step forward tonight and
generously contribute to uplift and empower mothers from lower-income families.
Together, we can foster a strong social compact to ensure that no one is
left behind.</p>
<p>I wish you all a Happy Mother’s Day and hope you enjoy the evening. Thank
you very much.</p>
