<p>Chairman, with your permission I will take any clarifications after this
speech subject to availability of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Introduction</u>
</p>
<p>This year, we celebrate 60 years of nation building. We have come a long
way as a people and a nation, and together we have built a Singapore we
can be proud of.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To ensure that Singapore continues to thrive, we must address two demographic
challenges which are also faced by many other societies around the world
– a rapidly-ageing population, and a low fertility rate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last year, there were 24,800 resident marriages. We also welcomed 30,800
resident births, a slight increase from 30,500 in the previous year.<sup>1</sup> Our
preliminary Total Fertility Rate or TFR for 2024 was 0.97, unchanged from
2023. The Dragon year effect has been diminishing over the years, reflecting
the generational shifts in attitudes and priorities among young couples.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked about the updated ratio of working
adults to retirees. A decade ago, there were 6 residents aged 20 to 64
years old supporting every elderly person aged 65 years and over. The resident
old-age support ratio has almost halved from 6 in 2014 to 3.5 in 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A low fertility rate and an ageing population have significant implications
on our economy and society. As our local workforce growth slows, it will
be increasingly challenging to sustain economic growth and maintain a dynamic
economy. There will be fewer young people to support a growing elderly
population.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Supporting Singaporeans’ Marriage &amp; Parenthood Aspirations</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Addressing our low TFR remains a national priority.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling</strong> suggested working with academics and studying
other countries' practices to tackle low fertility. We are doing so, and
also regularly engage Singaporeans, to develop policies that fit our local
context.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As shared during the Motion on Families earlier this month, we have a
comprehensive suite of measures to support Singaporeans in their marriage
and parenthood journey – from housing, healthcare, preschool and education
to financial and work-life support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have made significant enhancements in recent years. In 2023, we enhanced
the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and contributions to the Child Development Account
or CDA. We have reviewed and will be expanding the uses of CDA to better
support parents. MSF will share more at their COS. In 2024, we launched
the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests. The enhanced
Government-Paid Paternity Leave and new Shared Parental Leave or SPL, announced
by PM last year will start from 1 April this year. This month in Budget
2025, PM announced the new Large Families Scheme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Mindset and Culture Shifts</u>
</p>
<p>But for these policies to work, we need mindsets and culture to shift
in tandem. This requires support from everyone across society as highlighted
by <strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A key area is workplace support<strong>.</strong> Employers, supervisors
and co-workers can all contribute to fostering a family-friendly workplace
culture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the new SPL is fully implemented next year, parents will have 30
weeks of paid parental leave to care for their infants in the first year
after birth. This will foster the parent-child bond, and it is good for
the child’s development too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know it is not easy for employers to manage when their employees are
away for an extended period. That is why it is so important for employees
and employers to build mutual trust and play their part in making the leave
provisions work for both parties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Employees should discuss their leave plans and covering arrangements with
their supervisors and coworkers as early as possible. At the same time,
managers and coworkers ought to be supportive and facilitative, so parents
feel reassured about taking time away from work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As <strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> highlighted, fathers should be encouraged
to fully utilise their paternity leave. One key step we have taken is to
introduce employment protection for fathers on paternity leave from April
this year. We will study utilisation patterns and see how to better support
fathers who encounter challenges in using their leave.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Various Members asked for further support for working parents. Suggestions
include providing more leave for parents of preschoolers, those with pre-term
and multiple births, larger families, as well as those seeking fertility
treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At present, each working parent with a youngest child aged below seven
years old has six days of paid childcare leave a year. This means a working
couple would have a total of 12 days to tap on, more than the&nbsp;number
of preschool closure&nbsp;days that <strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan</strong> mentioned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also doubled Unpaid Infant Care Leave since 2024, where
each working parent will have 12 days per parent per year, in the child’s
first two years.&nbsp; These parental leave provisions are provided on
top of the parents’ annual leave provisions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will continue to review our parental leave provisions in consultation
with parents and Tripartite Partners. While we understand the desire for
more childcare leave, any further leave enhancement has to be carefully
considered and must strike a balance between the needs of different caregivers
and the operational impact on employers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More broadly, however, we do need employers to embrace more family-friendly
workplace practices. For instance, Flexible Work Arrangements (or FWAs)
are an important form of support for parents with young children, and other
workers with caregiving responsibilities. When implemented well, FWAs enable
employees to balance their responsibilities both at work, and at home.
With the implementation of the Tripartite Guidelines on FWA Requests from
December last year, I hope that more employers will embrace FWAs as part
of their core HR strategy. Employers are also encouraged to go beyond the
legislated leave provisions to position themselves as employers of choice.
For example, more than 4,000 employers have adopted the Tripartite Standard
on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> suggested incentivising businesses, to ensure
their employees take parental leave. In reality, new workplace norms are
emerging and the younger generation of workers value greater work-life
balance. If employers want to continue to attract and retain talent in
their companies, their workplace practices will have to evolve. For example,
Adecco Group APAC Pte Ltd<strong> </strong>has an employee who will be
eligible for the new Shared Parental Leave. They plan to hire temporary
and contract staff as covering manpower, so that the employee can take
her parental leave with peace of mind. When the employee returns to work,
Adecco will also make available suitable flexible work arrangements. This
will allow the employee to balance her work and family commitments while
still ensuring the company’s work gets done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> can rest assured that we will continue
to work with employers to foster more family-friendly workplaces and encourage
those who can, to go beyond what is mandated. The wider community can also
play a part in supporting working parents, as <strong>Mr Wan Rizal</strong> highlighted.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Support for Large Families</u>
</p>
<p>The Large Families Scheme<strong> </strong>is a significant move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Marriage &amp; Parenthood Surveys show over a third of married couples
aspire to have three or more children. However, fewer married couples are
having more than two children. Some worry about having less time for each
child. Others may be daunted by the prospect of higher expenses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our existing support measures recognise this. For example, parents receive
more under the Baby Bonus Scheme and Parenthood Tax Rebate for each subsequent
child they have.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we want to give greater assurance to couples who wish to have larger
families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Large Families Scheme will provide more financial support for large
families for a start. Families will receive an additional $16,000 for each
third or subsequent child, born on or after 18 February this year.&nbsp;
The CDA First Step Grant will be doubled from $5,000 to $10,000, and the
families will receive a new Large Family MediSave Grant of $5,000, and
$6,000 in Large Family LifeSG Credits. Existing large families will receive
$1,000 in Large Family LifeSG Credits annually, for each third child or
subsequent child until the year the child turns 6.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The LifeSG credits will provide sustained support for large families.
Parents can use these credits to buy groceries at major supermarkets, or
to top up the family’s SimplyGo cards for public transport. They can also
be used to pay for rides from transport operators that accept NETS QR payment,
like <strong>TADA</strong> and <strong>ComfortDelGro</strong> taxis. We will
provide more information on how to access and use the credits later this
year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We recognise large families also face other challenges as highlighted
by various Members during the Budget debate. For example, they may require
larger housing, face difficulties getting around as a family, or worry
about the costs of higher education that increase with more children. We
will study Members’ suggestions on how to further support large families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr<strong> Yip Hon Weng</strong> highlighted the need for whole-of-society
support to shift norms and encourage larger families. We agree. We hope
the Large Families Scheme will kickstart a societal movement to celebrate
and support these families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have been engaging corporates to support the Large Families Scheme
by offering privileges and deals for families with three or more children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am happy to share that more than 30 corporate partners spanning different
sectors have come on board, including food and beverage, retail and transport.
For example, to help larger families travel around more easily, private-hire
services like Grab and Gojek will be offering discounts on bookings with
their larger vehicles. Car-sharing services like Tribecar and GetGo will
be offering discounts on car rentals. HomeTeamNS will be offering bundle
promotions for tickets to their clubhouse family events, adventure and
children’s facilities, as well as discounted membership fees. FairPrice
Group will also be offering value bundles for large families to provide
savings on essential groceries. These will be provided later this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to thank all corporate partners who have committed to providing
deals to support families with more children. We encourage more corporates
to join us in this movement. Together, let’s make Singapore a conducive
place for large families to thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Providing Support Upstream for Fertility Health and Antenatal Care</u>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Hany Soh </strong>and<strong> Ms Ng Ling Ling</strong> highlighted
the importance of raising awareness on fertility health issues. I agree.
Fertility health can be a difficult topic to broach. We need to change
mindsets and normalise conversations about fertility health and support
couples who have fertility health concerns to seek help without fear of
stigma. The wider community can play an important role in this. Ground-up
efforts by groups like Fertility Support SG provide a safe space for couples
facing infertility to share their experiences. It also recently organised
a fertility fair to raise awareness of the fertility health resources and
support available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To address the myths and misconceptions about fertility health, we collaborated
with the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society of Singapore to publish an
article titled “Debunking 5 Myths of Fertility Health” on Health Hub.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;It
contains information on commonly faced fertility issues and provides useful
resources for couples seeking help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me assure <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> and <strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> that
we will continue to support those who are tapping on fertility treatments.
Today, eligible couples can receive up to 75% in co-funding for Assisted
Reproduction Technology treatments for up to three fresh and three frozen
cycles at public healthcare institutions. They can also tap on their MediSave
for the treatment costs, up to a lifetime withdrawal limit of $15,000 per
patient.</p>
<p>We have made some progress in supporting fertility issues in Singapore,
but more can be done. With more Singaporeans marrying and having children
later<sup>3</sup>, as <strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong> and <strong>Mr Louis Ng</strong> pointed
out, we may need to relook our support on this front. &nbsp;I thank Members
for their suggestions. We will study these ideas with MOH.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Hany Soh </strong>spoke about providing more support for those
who are expecting. The antenatal journey can be daunting, especially for
first-time parents. Expecting couples today can access the Health Promotion
Board’s Parent Hub, a one-stop online portal with health-related resources
and tips for their pregnancy and parenting journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Child and Maternal Health and Well-being Strategy and Action Plan
also provides enhanced support for pregnant women and couples, such as
the introduction of mental health screenings and support for pregnant women
and new fathers at antenatal and postnatal stages at KK Women’s and Children’s
Hospital and National University Hospital. More antenatal education programmes
have also been rolled out at community touchpoints, to help couples better
prepare themselves for pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have taken note of Ms Hany Soh’s suggestions, and we will look into
them. We welcome further suggestions on how we can make the antenatal journey
more positive for expecting couples.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Celebrating SG60 Births</u>
</p>
<p>This year, we celebrate our 60<sup>th</sup> year of independence. As PM
mentioned at Budget, all Singapore Citizen babies born in 2025 will receive
a special SG60 Baby Gift to celebrate their birth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng </strong>will be happy to hear that the Gift represents
our commitment towards building a Singapore Made For Families. It is also
a symbol of our hopes and aspirations for our future generations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many people have been asking about the SG60 Baby Gift. Chairperson, with
your permission, may I show an image on the LED screens to give Members
a preview of the SG60 Baby Gift?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Gift comes with a specially designed trolley bag which can double
up as a travel case for the baby and contains a specially curated set of
10 commemorative and useful items, sourced from local brands or companies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They include practical items like a straw cup set from local brand, Hegen,
which comes with their patented adaptor cap to meet the babies’ needs as
they gain more independence feeding themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are educational items like storybooks by local authors featuring
Becky Bunny, our mascot for the Families For Life movement as well as a
plushie of Becky Bunny. We encourage parents to bond with their babies
over these books and inspire a love of reading through them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other items include play items that will help their babies in their growth
and development, as well as items for parents to mark their precious moments
with their little ones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students from LASALLE College of the Arts designed the artwork that you
can see on the SG60 Baby Gift items.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each Gift set comes with a congratulatory letter from PM Wong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We hope parents will find the Gift meaningful and useful – to inspire
their child in discovering the world around them, and to support parents
in nurturing and caring for their child.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parents whose babies are born in 2025 will be able to register online
for the Gift. We will launch the distribution of the Gift at various community
events in April and May 2025. &nbsp;We hope that families will be able
to join the event in their neighbourhood and get to know other young parents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For those who are unable to collect the Gift at these events, or who register
for the SG60 Baby Gift after 15 March 2025, we will arrange for the Gift
to be delivered to your homes from mid-May 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>SG60 Values of Openness and Multiculturalism</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we celebrate SG60, allow me to highlight two values which have served
us well over the last 60 years: openness and multiculturalism. These are
fundamental aspects of who we are and key strengths that help us to make
our way in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Immigrants help to moderate the impact of low birth rates and ageing,
on the size and age profile of the citizen population.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will continue to carefully manage the pace of immigration, taking into
account factors such as the falling TFR.<strong> </strong>In 2024, we granted
about 24,000 new citizenships, including 1,400 to children born overseas
to Singaporean parents. We also granted around 35,000 new Permanent Residencies,
or PRs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The average number of new citizenships and new PRs granted annually over
the past five years is slightly higher than that over the preceding period.
We remain committed to ensuring that our new citizens and PRs are well-integrated
into our communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can all play our part to embrace the newcomers in our midst and help
them to better understand our local norms and culture. Over time, many
of them become not just friends but also family. Over the last decade,
more than one-third of citizen marriages every year were transnational,
meaning marriages involving a Singaporean and a foreigner. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>One such transnational family is Kiren T and Angela Bueno’s family. Kiren,
a Singaporean Indian, and Angela, a PR originally from the Philippines,
met while working in the same children’s ward in NUH. They fell in love
working and doing their in-house advanced diploma together, and got married
in 2016. Today, they have two children, a boy and girl, aged 9 and 7.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are many such stories. Many transnational couples make Singapore
their home; and over time, these foreign spouses become one of us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Carrie Tan</strong> asked whether the Government could facilitate
long-term visit passes, or LTVPs, for foreign parents of transnational
couples, to help with the couple’s parenting journey. Today, Singapore
citizens and PRs can apply to sponsor their own foreign parents for a LTVP,
subject to the prevailing criteria. These LTVPs come with a validity of
up to five years and can be renewed. This relatively long period provides
some certainty, to help transnational couples in planning their caregiving
arrangements.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will continue to review our population strategies to ensure that they
remain relevant in meeting our needs. As we look to the next 60 years and
beyond, let us work together to build stronger families, a more united
society and a brighter future for Singapore.</p>
