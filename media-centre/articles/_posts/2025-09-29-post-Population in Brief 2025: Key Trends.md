<p>The Population in Brief (PIB) 2025 publication provides key updates on
Singapore’s population. Here’s a snapshot of the key trends:</p>
<p><strong>1. Overall population</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Overall, Singapore’s total population stood at 6.11 million as at June
2025, a 1.2% increase from June 2024. The annualised population growth
rate over the past five years (2020-2025) was higher than the preceding
five-year period (2015-2020), mostly due to an increase in the number of
Work Permit Holders in the Construction sector to support key infrastructure
projects such as Changi Terminal 5 and the ramping up of housing supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The citizen population increased by 0.7% (3.64 million to 3.66 million),
while the Permanent Resident population remained stable at 0.54 million
in June 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Non-Resident population stood at 1.91 million, an increase of 2.7%
from June 2024. The increase came primarily from Work Permit Holders and
Migrant Domestic Workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Citizen marriages</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There were 22,955 citizen marriages in 2024, 5.7% lower than the 24,355
citizen marriages in 2023, but higher than the 22,165 citizen marriages
in 2019 (pre-COVID). The average number of citizen marriages per year in
the last five years (23,000) was slightly lower than that of the preceding
five years (23,600).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Citizen births</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There were 29,237 citizen births in 2024, 1.2% more than the 28,877 citizen
births in 2023. The average number of births per year in the last five
years (30,400) was lower than in the preceding five years (32,900). The
resident total fertility rate was 0.97 in 2024, unchanged from 2023.</p>
</li>
