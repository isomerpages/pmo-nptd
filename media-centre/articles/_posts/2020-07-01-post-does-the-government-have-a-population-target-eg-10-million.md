The Government has not proposed, planned nor targeted for Singapore to increase its population to 10 million. The Government has explained its population policies in an earlier article [here](/media-centre/articles/what-is-the-aim-of-government-population-policies).

We monitor our population trends closely, and regularly review our population policies along with infrastructure and social development needs. An [update](https://www.strategygroup.gov.sg/media-centre/speeches/2018-03-01-speech-by-minister-josephine-teo-population) on our population outlook was provided in Parliament in March 2018. At that update, the Government said that given recent trends, Singaporeâ€™s total population is likely to be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030. This outlook remains valid today.
