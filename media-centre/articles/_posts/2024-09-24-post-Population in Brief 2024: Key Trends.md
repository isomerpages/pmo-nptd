<p>The Population in Brief (PIB) 2024 publication provides key updates on
Singapore’s population. Here’s a snapshot of the key trends:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Overall population</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Overall, Singapore’s total population stood at 6.04 million as at June
2024, a 2.0% increase from June 2023. This increase was mainly due to the
growth in the non-resident population. The annualised population growth
rate of 1.1% over the last five years (2019-2024) was slightly higher than
the 0.8% over the preceding five-year period (2014-2019).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The citizen population increased by 0.7% from 3.61 million in June 2023
to 3.64 million in June 2024. The Permanent Resident population increased
by 1.2% from 538,600 in June 2023 to 544,900 in June 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The non-resident&nbsp;population increased by 5.0% from 1.77 million in
June 2023 to 1.86 million in June 2023. The increase was seen across most
pass types, with Work Permit Holders contributing most to the increase,
followed by Migrant Domestic Workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Citizen marriages</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In 2023, there were 24,355 citizen marriages, 1.7% fewer than the record
high of 24,767 citizen marriages in 2022, but higher than the 22,165 citizen
marriages in 2019 (pre-COVID). The average number of citizen marriages
per year in the last five years (22,800) was lower than in the preceding
five years (24,000).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Citizen births</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There were 28,877 citizen births in 2023, 5.1% fewer than the 30,429 citizen
births in 2022. The average number of births per year in the last five
years (31,100) was lower than in the preceding five years (33,000). The
resident total fertility rate (TFR) was 0.97 in 2023.</p>
