<p>Our population size is affected by many factors, including birth rates,
life expectancy, as well as global developments. The Government aims to
achieve a careful balance between these factors to ensure a sustainable
Singapore with a cohesive society and vibrant economy that improves Singaporeans’
lives.</p>
<p>The Government does not seek to achieve any particular population size.
We monitor our population trends closely, and regularly review our population
policies along with infrastructure and social development needs. An update
on our population outlook was provided in Parliament over a few occasions.
At 2023 Committee of Supply debate, Minister Indranee Rajah shared that
the population was likely to be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030,
and that based on the various scenarios that the Government had, the planning
parameter of 6.9 million remained relevant for the 2030s. At that update,
the Government said that given recent trends, Singapore’s total population
is likely to be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030.</p>
