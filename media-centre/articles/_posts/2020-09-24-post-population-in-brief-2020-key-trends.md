The Population in Brief (PIB) 2020 provides key updates and trends on Singapore’s population. Here’s a snapshot of what the key trends are:  

1. **Citizen marriages**
  * In 2019, there were 22,165 citizen marriages, compared to 23,632 citizen marriages in 2018. Over the last five years (2015 to 2019), there were about 23,600 citizen marriages on average each year, more than the average of 22,400 each year in the previous five years (2010 to 2014).
2. **Citizen births**
  * There were 32,844 citizen births in 2019, compared to 32,413 citizen births in 2018. Over the last five years (2015 to 2019), there were about 32,900 citizen births on average each year, higher than the average of 31,700 each year in the previous five years (2010 to 2014). The resident total fertility rate remained at 1.14 in 2019, unchanged from the year before.
3. **Overall population**
  * The citizen population grew by 0.6 per cent, to reach 3.52 million as of June 2020. The citizen population continues to age steadily, with 16.8 per cent aged 65 and above compared with 16.0 per cent last year. The permanent resident population remained stable at 0.52 million as of June 2020.
  * The non-resident population decreased by 2.1 per cent, to reach 1.64 million as of June 2020. This was largely due to a reduction in foreign employment in Services, from June 2019 to June 2020. By pass type, Work Permit Holders saw the largest decrease. 
  * Overall, Singapore’s total population stands at 5.69 million as of June 2020. The total population decreased slightly by 0.3 per cent from June 2019 to June 2020. This was largely due to the decrease in the non-resident population.
