2014 has seen a rise of 10% in the number of marriages involving at least one citizen. There were about 24,000 such marriages in 2014 - the highest number since 1997.

The Total Fertility Rate has also risen to 1.25 in 2014 from 1.19 the year before. Citizen births increased from around 31,000 births in 2013, to about 33,000 births last year.

The increase in marriages is likely to be due in part to the greater availability of HDB flats, and in part to more Singaporeans, the children of our Baby Boomers, entering marriageable age. The Government has been supporting them in fulfilling their aspirations to marry and have children, for example by increasing the supply of HDB flats. We will continue to support Singaporean families, including in the area of child care, and make it easier for both fathers and mothers to share the experience of bringing up their children.

Said Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Grace Fu: "I am delighted to see more Singaporeans finding love and joy from setting up new families with their loved ones and having children of their own. This is indeed a good SG50 present for Singapore as she celebrates her 50 years of independence. I hope that these positive trends will continue in Singapore's Jubilee year as we gain confidence in Singapore's future as a good place to raise our families, where many opportunities for education and jobs await our children."
