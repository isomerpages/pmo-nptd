Singaporeans have given about 6,500 suggestions on possible items that can go into the Jubilee Baby Gift. These were collected from various platforms, namely The Jubilee BabyGift microsite, feedback booths, focus group sessions, and REACH’s online platforms from 1 – 15 April. Baby-related items as well as commemorative gifts comprised 70% of all suggestions. The breakdown of the types of suggestions received can be found in Annex A.

The five-member Jubilee Baby Gift Advisory Panel 1 comprising people sector representatives have curated and shortlisted the items based on suggestions by Singaporeans. The shortlist includes a mix of items incorporating three elements, namely - “Care” for the baby; “Celebrate” the baby and family bonding, and “Commemorate” the baby’s birth in SG50 with keepsake items. The Advisory Panel also took into account feedback from The Jubilee Baby Gift focus group discussions, such as the need to ensure that the cost of the Gift is reasonable and on items that should not be included (e.g. no perishables and food/medicinal items). Items that were not shortlisted included those which would be consumed quickly or which might not be suitable for all babies, such as diapers or milk powder, or those that were not commemorative or keepsake in nature, such as vouchers.

The shortlist of 15 items is as follows:

<sub><sup>1 While the NPTD engages Singaporeans widely on their ideas for The Jubilee Baby Gift, our Advisory Panel will curate the Singaporeans’ suggestions arising from the public engagement, and will advise on the suitability of the items and the design of The Jubilee Baby Gift. 
The Advisory Panel is chaired by Ms Anita Fam, who serves on the council of Families for Life (FFL). Members include Mrs Joni Ong, the President of I Love Children; Ms Toh Hwee Tin, the Director of NTUC’s Family Development Unit and U Family Community; Dr Jazlan Joosoph, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Raffles Hospital; and Mr Jim Lim, the Founder of the REAL Academy, Academy, a relationship consultancy firm for families, schools and corporations.</sup>

  *-Commemorative elements may be included through the design for these items.

Ms Anita Fam, Chairperson of The Jubilee Baby Gift Advisory Panel said: “We have been most encouraged by the enthusiastic response given by our fellow Singaporeans. These suggestions have come from Singaporeans from all walks of life, including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and children. They cover a broad range of items which convey our hopes and aspirations for the next generation - which is very much in the spirit of what the Jubilee Baby Gift is all about. ”

**Public Voting Starts Today**

The second phase of the public engagement exercise starts today until 15 May 2014. During this period, Singaporeans can select their five preferred items that they would like to see in the Jubilee Baby Gift. They can do so online at [www.nptd.gov.sg/jubilee](https://www.nptd.gov.sg/jubilee)

The final set of items will be announced in the middle of the year following the close of the public engagement exercise.

The Jubilee Baby Gift is a community initiative led by the National Population and Talent Division, supported by REACH, the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Families for Life, NTUC U Family, and I Love Children. In conjunction with the SG50 celebrations to commemorate Singapore’s Golden Jubilee, the Gift will consist of a small set of meaningful items from all Singaporeans to welcome every Singaporean baby born in 2015. The Jubilee Baby Gift symbolises our best wishes, hopes and aspirations from this generation of Singaporeans to the next.
