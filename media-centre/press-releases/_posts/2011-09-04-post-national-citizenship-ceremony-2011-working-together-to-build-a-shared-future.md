The National Citizenship Ceremony 2011 (NCC 2011), held on 4 September 2011, saw 133 new citizens receiving their citizenship certificates from Guest-of-Honour Assoc Prof Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs and Grassroots Adviser to Moulmein-Kallang GRC (Kolam Ayer). Similar GRC-level ceremonies were also held over the same weekend, which saw about 2800 other new citizens affirming their commitment to the nation.

In his opening remarks at the NCC 2011, Assoc Prof Yaacob highlighted that even as Singapore continues to welcome new citizens, they should uphold Singaporean values and build a shared future together. Assoc Prof Yaacob said, “I am confident our new Singaporeans will embrace these values that define us and help enlarge the common spaces that help bind us as one people even as we celebrate our unique diversity.”

Assoc Prof Yaacob also urged new citizens to play a part in contributing to the nation through active community involvement. He said, “I encourage you to continue deepening your appreciation of Singapore, reaching out to your fellow Singaporeans and working together for the good of the country and the community to make Singapore our best home.”

Agreeing with Assoc Prof Yaacob’s comments, China-born new citizen Julie Wu said, “I am very happy that my involvement in community projects has helped improve the living environment not just for myself but also for my neighbours living in the estate. It has also allowed me to give back to society and enriched my life as I met new people and made many friends in the process.”

New citizen Muhamed Eusuff Rahamathulla, who was previously from Chennai, India, also shared that volunteering at community events had helped him and his family ease into their new life here. He said, “I often participate in community events with my family as we find these activities very interesting and meaningful. Being active in my neighbourbood and community has helped us better integrate into the way of life in Singapore, and I strongly encourage fellow new citizens to step forward and participate too.”

Organised by the National Integration Council and supported by the People’s Association, the NCC is an annual event where new Singapore citizens receive their National Registration Identification Cards (NRICs) and certificates of citizenship. Held since 2007, the ceremony highlights the significance of citizenship, where new citizens commit themselves to a shared future with fellow Singaporeans. The NCC is rotated among the Group Representation Constituencies annually. This year, new citizens from the Moulmein-Kallang GRC and Whampoa Single Member Constituency participated in NCC 2011.
