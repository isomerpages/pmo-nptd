**SINGAPORE BOOK OF RECORDS: NEW RECORD SET FOR "LARGEST MASS STROLLER WALK"**

**19 December 2015 -** 1,500 walkers set a new record in the Singapore Book of Records for the “Largest Mass Stroller Walk” after completing a 1.5km route around the Singapore Sports Hub.

**Acting Minister for Education (Schools)** and Senior Minister of State for Transport **Ng Chee Meng** flagged off the walk. **MP Tin Pei Ling** and her family also participated in the Stroller Walk which marked the start of the inaugural National Play Day Carnival.

The National Play Day Carnival is a community event to celebrate parenthood and families in Singapore, organised by the public, private and community sectors. The Carnival comprises eight Play Zones with free play and family-bonding activities for children and parents (see Annex A). Community partners such as the SG50 Jubilee Babies, Jubilant Nation group (a Facebook community group comprising over 12,000 SG50Baby parents). I Love Children, and Families for Life also joined in the festivities.

**Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean,** the Guest of Honour at National Play Day, said "National Play Day brings parents and children to have fun together, to celebrate the joys and fulfilment of parenthood. Increasingly we see mothers and fathers playing a more active role in shared parenting, with support from many grandparents. I’m heartened to see strong community support for parenthood. The Government will continue to work with the private sector and community to make Singapore an even better place for Singaporeans to start families and raise children."

MP Tin Pei Ling, who took part as a Special Guest at the inaugural Stroller Walk with her SG50 Baby and spouse, said "As a new mum, I’m glad to see such strong support for young parents – whether it’s through events like the National Play Day that brings the community together, or through more measures in the Marriage & Parenthood Package that were introduced this year. I am particularly glad to see so many hands-on Dads at the Stroller Walk today. With parents working as a team to raise our children and with support from the community, we look forward to an even more family-friendly Singapore in the years to come."
