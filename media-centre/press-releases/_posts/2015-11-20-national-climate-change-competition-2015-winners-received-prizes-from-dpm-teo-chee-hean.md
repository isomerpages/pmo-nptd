**Singapore, 20 November 2015 -** The winners of the National Climate Change Competition (NCCC) 2015 received their prizes this afternoon from Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, and Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change.

Organised by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), the competition seeks to raise awareness and understanding of climate change, its impact and how everyone can play a part in addressing the problem.  This year’s theme “Our Climate Our Choice” highlights the close connection between our daily choices and climate change, and the urgent need to reduce Singapore’s carbon footprint by conserving energy.

The NCCC 2015 attracted more than 170 entries from primary and secondary schools, junior colleges and institutes of higher learning, as well as members of the public. The videos were judged based on their creativity, originality and how well they conveyed the message of climate change. The following entries were selected as the winners in their respective categories:

In his speech at the prize award ceremony, DPM Teo commended the participants for helping to raise awareness on climate change.  He also called on Singaporeans to build a more climate-friendly Singapore through their daily actions to conserve energy, for example by choosing energy efficient appliances, or by taking public transport or car-pooling.
