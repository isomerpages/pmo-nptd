Mr Niam Chiang Meng, 58, Permanent Secretary (National Population and Talent Division, NPTD) and Permanent Secretary (National Climate Change Secretariat, NCCS), Prime Minister's Office, will retire from the Administrative Service on 1 August 2016 after 33 years of distinguished service in the public sector. Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Mr Teo Chee Hean, who has worked closely with Mr Niam in NPTD and NCCS, and also in the field of sports development and promotion, thanked Mr Niam for his leadership and contributions in these important areas.

From 1 August 2016, NPTD and NCCS will form part of Strategy Group, under the Prime Minister's Office.

The inclusion of NPTD which coordinates and formulates whole-of-government policies on population and talent, and NCCS which leads a whole-of-nation effort to address the challenges and opportunities of climate change, will enhance strategy-making and planning on vital issues that span multiple Government ministries and agencies.

Permanent Secretary (Prime Minister's Office)(Strategy), Mr Peter Ong, will take over from Mr Niam Chiang Meng in overseeing the work of NPTD and NCCS with effect from 1 August 2016. Mr Ong holds a concurrent appointment as Head of Civil Service.
