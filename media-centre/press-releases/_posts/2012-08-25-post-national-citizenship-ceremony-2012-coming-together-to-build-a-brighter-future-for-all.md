The National Citizenship Ceremony 2012 held on 25 August 2012 saw 128 new citizens receiving their Singapore citizenship certificates. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Finance, MP for Jurong Group Representation Constituency and Adviser to Jurong GRC Grassroots Organisations, was the Guest-of-Honour at the event. About 2,800 other new citizens would also be affirming their commitment to Singapore at 12 GRC-level ceremonies across the island the same weekend.

In his opening remarks, DPM Tharman emphasised that interaction was key to building mutual trust and understanding between locals and new citizens. He urged new citizens to reach out and expand their social networks with fellow Singaporeans who can be a source of support as they settle into the Singapore family.

The ceremony also saw 13 young National Servicemen receiving their pink identity cards. New citizen David Mui, 25, who is among the 13, came to Singapore as a young child and grew up here. He made many good friends when he served National Service (NS), and felt that NS helped people from different backgrounds and cultures forge friendships and get to know one another better. He said, “My best friends were made during NS, because we went through a lot of things together that you can’t experience in the outside world”.

At the event, DPM Tharman also encouraged new citizens to contribute to the community in their own way. New citizen Suksri Lumprasert, 44, who is active in volunteer work, believes that community activities were the best way for new immigrants to feel that they belonged here and had a stake in Singapore. Married to a Singaporean with two children who are also Singapore citizens, Madam Lumprasert said, “Becoming a Singaporean reflects my decision to commit to Singapore completely with my aspirations, my future and my family, whom I have here.”

Organised by the National Integration Council with the support of the People’s Association, the National Citizenship Ceremony is an annual event where new Singapore citizens are presented their National Registration Identification Cards (NRICs) and certificates of citizenship. First held in 2007, the ceremony commemorates the significance of citizenship and is a platform for new citizens to commit themselves to a shared future with fellow Singaporeans. The GRCs take turns to host the event each year, with Jurong GRC and Yuhua SMC taking the lead in 2012.
