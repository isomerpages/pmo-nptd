To ease couples’ financial concerns about having a child in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and recession, the Government will provide a **one-off Baby Support Grant (BSG) of $3,000 to supplement the existing Baby Bonus Cash Gift (BBCG), for children born from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2022**. The BSG adds to the Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Package, to further help couples defray child-raising costs during these extraordinary times.

**Supporting Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood journey**

Supporting Singaporeans in fulfilling their plans to marry and raise families is a key national priority. The Government’s M&P Package offers a comprehensive suite of support measures, which have been progressively enhanced since 2001. The latest round of enhancements in 2019/2020 has improved preschool affordability and accessibility, made housing more affordable for those buying their first homes from HDB, and provided additional healthcare support for children and couples.

However, we recognise that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented challenges to lives and livelihoods. Some couples have indicated that they will postpone their life plans in order to focus on their financial stability and employment prospects. In a recent survey commissioned by the National Population and Talent Division, and the Ministry of Social and Family Development, about 3 in 10 respondents said that they are likely to delay their plans to get married or to have a child, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the economy. As age affects fertility, marrying and having children later may result in families being unable to have the number of children they aspire to have. 

**One-off $3,000 Baby Support Grant**

The BSG is a one-off grant of $3,000 for children who are born from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2022 (both dates inclusive), and who are eligible for the BBCG.

The BSG will be deposited into the same bank account as nominated by parents when they enrol their child for the Baby Bonus Scheme (BBS) and its Cash Gift. Parents will receive the BSG from 1 April 2021, or within one month of enrolment into BBS, whichever is later. More information on the BSG can be found on [MadeForFamilies.gov.sg](https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg).

**Together we can build a Singapore that is Made For Families**

Companies and community partners have also stepped forward during this challenging period to provide extra support to families with young children. One such company is mothercare, run by Kim Hin International, a Singapore family-owned business. mothercare will be giving away their VIP membership to all Singaporeans who are giving birth over the next 12 months. This will entitle them to special discounts. In addition, mothercare has put together several special deals on baby essentials to assist parents better manage costs.

“In keeping with our organisation’s mission, we are proud to be part of this national initiative to support Singaporeans as they start and raise families. mothercare not only provides care and support to our customers, but also to our employees. Our family-friendly staff welfare policies provide employees with store credits and free products, such as our Love Amme breast pumps, and help for new parents to manage the transition into parenthood with flexible work arrangements”, said Mr Pang Fu Wei, Group Managing Director of Kim Hin International.

Community partners like Families for Life (FFL) have actively organised Facebook live sessions fronted by experts as part of its #AskFFL series. For example, gynaecologists assuring couples on health and safety on having children during this period. To help first-time parents better prepare for pregnancy and parenthood, the Baby Bonus Parenting Resources portal offers extensive information to support confident parenting. Said Dr Ann Tan, gynaecologist and FFL Council member, “Singapore hospitals have stringent safeguards in place to reduce risks of infection and thus maintain the safety and health of both mother and child during pregnancy and after childbirth. Together, we can all ensure that our families stay healthy during this period.”

The Government encourages more employers, companies and community groups to support Singaporeans in their parenthood aspirations. Extended family and friends can also show their support for couples planning to start families, and for families with young children. 

Minister Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, National Population and Talent Division, said: “This pandemic has not been easy on Singaporeans who are planning to get married and start their families. The Government will spare no effort to help couples meet their marriage and parenthood aspirations. We also hope that more businesses and community groups will play their part to support couples juggle work and family, provide affordable goods and services for young families, and ultimately, create a Singapore that is made for families.”
