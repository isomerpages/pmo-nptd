**Together, Singapore is Made For Families**

“*Made for Families*” is a new brand mark that represents the different ways - big and small - in which Singapore supports families. The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions have made clearer the importance of building and maintaining strong family ties at home, as well as supporting employees to balance their family and career aspirations. Businesses, organisations and community groups can adopt this *Made For Families* brand mark to identify themselves as promoting the value of family in our society. Government programmes that help couples marry, start and bring up their families will also be identified as reasons why Singapore is *Made for Families*. An initiative by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) in the Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office, *Made For Families* aims to assure families in Singapore of support from the government and community at large as we emerge stronger from this crisis. It will be launched today and progressively rolled out across Singapore.

**#WeAreMadeForFamilies challenge**

To kick-start the effort is a **#WeAreMadeForFamilies challenge**. Businesses, organisations and community groups are encouraged to showcase their efforts in supporting parents in raising children, and let families know that there is a supportive community around them, especially as they face the challenges of dealing with COVID-19. Many employers have gone the extra mile during Circuit Breaker by helping their staff adjust to working from home with their children around. 

Businesses, organisations and community groups can take part in the **#WeAreMadeForFamilies** challenge in the following ways:

* Go to the *Made For Families page* ([go.gov.sg/MadeForFamilies](https://www.go.gov.sg/MadeForFamilies)) to register, share how they support families, and subsequently receive the brand mark. They can also download a profile picture frame for social media; 

* Share on their respective social media channel(s) on how their organisation is *Made For Families*. They can highlight their **family-friendly programmes, policies, practices, amenities, products** or **services**, and use the hashtags **#WeAreMadeForFamilies** and **#SGUnited**. Entities may also wish to use the profile picture frame on their social media; 

To show that they identify themselves as a *Made For Families* entity, we encourage organisations to further show their support in the following ways:

* Adopt and display the *Made For Families* brand mark on the organisation’s website, collaterals and family-friendly initiatives; and 

* Place the *Made For Families* wobbler and decal at the organisation’s family-friendly amenities/premises. (The wobbler and decal are available upon request)

**Growing the Made For Families Ecosystem**
	
Many companies have stepped up during this challenging period to provide extra support to their employees, especially for employees with young children. These companies have contributed in their own ways to foster a society that is *Made For Families*. One such company is **Ohmyhome**, which has put in place flexible work arrangements for its employees, and also put together a COVID-19 survival toolkit filled with learning resources for parents with young children. Ms Rhonda Wong, CEO of Ohmyhome said: “My co-founder and I come from a very loving and close-knitted family and it is our wish to create that for our customers and teammates. We understand that juggling parenthood and working full-time is challenging, thus we want to support them in every way that we can to ensure that their journey with Ohmyhome is a rewarding one, one that is *Made For Families*.”

NPTD will also be working closely with Families For Life (FFL) to reach out to more organisations to adopt the *Made For Families* brand mark. FFL Council Chairman, Mr Ishak Ismail said: “FFL is happy to collaborate with NPTD to engage organisations to adopt the *Made For Families* brand mark and encourage them to take on the **#WeAreMadeForFamilies** challenge. In trying times like this, we would like parents to know that they are not alone in the parenting journey. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. I encourage the rest of the community to take part in the challenge to show how they are *Made For Families*.”
