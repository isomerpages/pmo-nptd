A vacuum cleaner that sorts waste for recycling.  More widespread use of solar energy. More bicycles than cars on the roads. These are some of the future scenarios of a climate-friendly Singapore painted in the winning entries from this year’s National Climate Change Competition (NCCC).

The NCCC is an annual video making competition organised by the National Climate Change Secretariat, a unit of the Prime Minister’s Office Strategy Group. The competition seeks to raise awareness of climate change and how everyone can play a part in addressing this issue.

The theme for this year’s competition, Singapore 2030: A Climate-Friendly City, challenges the students to think about how a climate-friendly Singapore will look like in year 2030. This is the year when Singapore is expected to fulfil its pledge of reducing Emissions Intensity <sup>1</sup> by 36 per cent from 2005 levels and stabilise its greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of peaking.

The teams behind the winning videos received their prizes from Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security, and Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, at an award ceremony this morning. Their entries were judged to be the most creative and relevant to the theme of the competition from among the 215 entries received this year.

In the Primary Schools category, the winning video “Vision 2030” was submitted by Juying Primary School. The students’ clay-mation depicts a boy’s dream of a sustainable Singapore in 2030 where the community is involved in growing their own food, recycling is a way of life and home appliances are powered by the sun and other forms of clean energy.

The first prize in the Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges category was presented to Maris Stella High School.  In their entry entitled “A Gift from the Future to the Past”, the protagonist’s future self pays him a visit to explain how our actions to address climate change today could contribute to a better Singapore in the future.

The top entry in the Institutes of Higher Learning category was submitted by ITE College East. Their animation depicts how a climate-friendly Singapore looks like in 2030 with buildings fitted with energy saving lifts and rooftop gardens to reduce urban heat, more accessible public transport options, as well as factories running on sustainable energy sources.

A Viewers’ Choice contest was conducted separately on NCCS’ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ClimateChangeSG/" target="_blank">Climate Change SG Facebook page</a> where members of the public voted for their favourite videos. The teams whose videos gathered the most votes in each category also received their prizes from DPM Teo.
