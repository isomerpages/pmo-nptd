**Clarification regarding recent statements on Singapore population 'target'**

There have been statements circulating on various online platforms, that the Government proposes or plans to increase the population in Singapore to 10 million. The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD), Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office, would like to state categorically that these statements are untrue. The Government has not proposed, planned nor targeted for Singapore to increase its population to 10 million. 

The Government regularly explains its approach to population planning, including through annual updates at the Committee of Supply debates. In a Factually [article](https://www.gov.sg/article/what-is-the-aim-of-government-population-policies) published in March 2020, the Government reiterated that Singapore’s population size is affected by many factors, including birth rates, life expectancy and global developments. The article also states that the Government does not seek to achieve any particular population size. The Government aims to achieve a careful balance between these factors, to ensure a sustainable Singapore with a cohesive society and vibrant economy that improves Singaporeans’ lives. 

We monitor our population trends closely, and regularly review our population policies along with infrastructure and social development needs. An update on our population outlook was provided in Parliament in March 2018. At that [update](https://www.strategygroup.gov.sg/media-centre/speeches/2018-03-01-speech-by-minister-josephine-teo-population), the Government said that given recent trends, Singapore’s total population is likely to be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030. This outlook remains valid today.

The publication of such falsehoods damages the public interest, by undermining legitimate and honest discussion. Appropriate action may be taken against any such further publication.
