<p>The Government recognises the importance of families in Singapore and
is committed to helping Singaporeans achieve their marriage and parenthood
aspirations. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, Coordinating Minister
for National Security and Minister-in-charge of population issues, announced
the enhanced Marriage &amp; Parenthood Package today. The enhanced package
aims to provide more comprehensive support for Singaporeans in getting
married and starting their families.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancements to the Marriage and Parenthood Package</strong>
</p>
<p>The enhancements aim to: (a) make it faster and easier for married couples
to get housing to support earlier marriages and births; (b) provide support
for medical costs related to conception and delivery costs; (c) further
defray child-raising costs, including healthcare costs; (d) enhance work-life
measures to help working couples to balance work and family commitments;
and (e) signal to fathers to play a bigger role in bringing up their children.</p>
<p>In summary, the following policy enhancements were announced:</p>
<p><strong>a) Make it faster and easier to get housing to support earlier marriages and births</strong>
</p>
<p>i) Parenthood Priority Scheme to provide priority allocation of new HDB
flats to first-timer married couples with children by setting aside a proportion
of flats for them.</p>
<p>ii) Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme to allow first-timer married
couples with children to rent a flat from HDB at an affordable rental rate
while awaiting completion of their flats.</p>
<p><strong>b) Provide support for medical costs related to conception and delivery</strong>
</p>
<p>iii) Enhanced Government co-funding for Assisted Reproduction Technology
(ART) treatments, to cover up to 75% of treatment costs, capped at $6,300
per cycle and $1,200 per cycle for 3 fresh and 3 frozen treatment cycles
respectively. Couples with more than one child will also be eligible for
cofunding.</p>
<p>iv) Accouchement fees in public hospitals will no longer be differentiated
across birth order.</p>
<p><strong>c) Further defray child-raising costs, including healthcare costs</strong>
</p>
<p>v) Enhanced Baby Bonus Cash Gift of $6,000 per child for the first two
births, and $8,000 per child for the third/fourth births. This marks an
increase of $2,000 per birth over the current Baby Bonus Cash Gift.</p>
<p>vi) Creation of a CPF Medisave account for each citizen newborn with a
grant of $3,000 to further support parents in planning for their children’s
healthcare needs and encourage early and continuous enrolment in MediShield.</p>
<p>vii) MediShield to be extended to cover congenital and neonatal conditions,
to take effect from 1 Mar 2013, at the same time as other broader changes
to MediShield announced earlier</p>
<p><strong>d) Enhance work-life measures to help working couples to balance work and family commitments</strong>
</p>
<p>viii) 2 days of Government-Paid Child Care Leave annually for parents
with children aged 7-12, to provide parents of children in primary school
with more time to tend to their children’s needs. Parents with at least
one child below age 7 will continue to have 6 days of Child Care Leave.</p>
<p>ix) 4 weeks of Government-Paid Adoption Leave for working mothers, to
support bonding with the adopted child in the child’s first year.</p>
<p>x) Government-Paid Maternity Benefit to allow working women who do not
currently qualify for any maternity leave (e.g. shorter-term contract workers)
to enjoy the Government paid share of maternity leave in the form of a
cash benefit.</p>
<p>xi) Extended maternity protection period to cover the full term of pregnancy,
for employees who are retrenched or dismissed without sufficient cause.</p>
<p><strong>e) Signal to fathers to play a bigger role in bringing up their children</strong>
</p>
<p>xii) 1 week of Government-Paid Paternity Leave for fathers.</p>
<p>xiii) 1 week of Government-Paid Shared Parental Leave to allow fathers
to share 1 week of the working mother’s maternity leave entitlement. Please

more details on the enhancements.</p>
<p>These enhancements complement existing Marriage &amp; Parenthood measures,
which include the Medisave Maternity Package, Child Development Account,
Parenthood Tax Rebate, Qualifying Child Relief and others. The enhanced
M&amp;P package has a new budget of $2 billion a year, up from the previous
$1.6 billion budget of the 2008 package. A summary of the enhanced Marriage
&amp; Parenthood Package can be found in Annex B.</p>
<p>“Addressing our falling birth rate requires a concerted effort beyond
Government initiatives. We will continue to work with the community to
strengthen positive attitudes towards family life. We hope that the enhanced
Marriage &amp; Parenthood measures will help create a more conducive environment
for Singaporeans to set up families.” said DPM Teo.</p>
<p><strong>Other measures under study</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, the Government is currently studying other measures pertaining
to the pre-school sector. Measures to address infant and child care fee
affordability will be announced on Wednesday. The Ministry of Manpower
is also studying ways to provide incentives for employers to offer flexible
work arrangements for their employees. These will complement the measures
under the enhanced Marriage &amp; Parenthood Package.</p>
<p><strong>Public engagement and feedback received</strong>
</p>
<p>The enhancements draw on suggestions made by Singaporeans in the public
engagement over the past year. During the review, NPTD engaged various
stakeholders such as community organisations and employers as well as the
members of the public.</p>
<p>The factors affecting Singaporeans’ decisions to get married and have
children are multi-faceted. There were practical concerns about access
to housing, the availability and cost of child care, healthcare expenses
and other costs of raising a family. Both men and women also expressed
the desire for better work-life harmony to fulfil their family and career
aspirations. Many reflected on the importance of family values, and pointed
out that it is ultimately values and social attitudes which will determine
personal decisions regarding marriage and parenthood.</p>
<p>NPTD also considered the proposals and suggestions submitted by various
organisations and interest groups, such as the National Family Council,
I Love Children, Singapore National Employers Federation, NTUC, PAP Women’s
Wing, AWARE, Focus on the Family, the Centre for Research on Islamic and
Malay Affairs, and Touch Community Services.</p>
<p>In total, NPTD received more than 800 pieces of feedback on marriage and
parenthood issues during the consultation period from 28 Jun to 31 Oct
2012. We would like to thank all contributors for their feedback and suggestions.</p>
