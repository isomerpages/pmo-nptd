As part of its ongoing public engagement on population issues, the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) is releasing an Issues Paper to: 

a. Set out our demographic challenges to understand the choices and trade-offs we must make as a nation; and 
b.Seek ideas and views from the public that will help us formulate our population policies.  
A copy of the paper is available for download at [www.population.sg.](https://www.population.sg) 

NPTD invites members of the public to share their views on population issues as it examines Singapore’s population goals and policies, with a view to releasing a White Paper on Population. 

**Public Engagement** 

Our demographic challenges are complex and have far-reaching implications on Singapore and Singaporeans. It is therefore important for us to comprehensively discuss this topic together as a nation. This will help us develop a shared understanding of the challenges confronting us, consider the trade-offs and find the right balance to build a sustainable population that is cohesive, provides a good living environment for our people, and maintains our economic vitality. 

Members of the public can submit their views and suggestions through the following channels from **26 Jul 2012 to 31 Oct 2012:** 

 a. Online: [www.population.sg](https://www.population.sg)   
 b. Email: [nptd_contact@nptd.gov.sg](mailto:nptd_contact@nptd.gov.sg)
