### SINGAPORE'S ENHANCED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION AND LONG-TERM LOW-EMISSIONS DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY



Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, who is also the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, said today that Singapore will submit its enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and its Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later this year. Mr Teo made the announcement during the Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2020.

**CHARTING SINGAPORE’S LOW-CARBON FUTURE**

Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. As a small low-lying island state, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

A clear long-term strategy will facilitate a well-managed transition to a low-carbon future for Singapore. It will also allow the country to seek new economic opportunities, and create new jobs.

**ENHANCEMENT OF 2030 NDC**

Singapore will enhance its 2030 NDC, to **peak emissions at 65MtCO<sub>2</sub>e around 2030**. Based on projections, this is consistent with Singapore’s existing 2030 NDC, which states that Singapore aims to achieve a 36 per cent reduction in Emissions Intensity (EI) from 2005 levels by 2030.

Singapore is already among the 20 best performing countries in EI globally. This enhancement to Singapore’s 2030 NDC will provide greater clarity to the international community that we will commit to an absolute peak emissions level.

Singapore will also expand the scope of the country’s pledge to include a seventh greenhouse gas (GHG), nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>)<sup>1</sup>within this peak emissions ceiling.

**LEDS**

Singapore also aims to **halve emissions from its peak to 33MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050**, **with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.**

Singapore’s enhanced NDC and LEDS aspiration sets out realistic but challenging and ambitious goals for Singapore, drawing on citizens’ suggestions and taking into account its national circumstances. These goals demonstrate Singapore’s seriousness and commitment to supporting international climate action and a low-carbon future.

**ENABLING SINGAPORE’S LOW-CARBON TRANSITION**

Singapore will take concrete actions across **all sectors** to facilitate the low-carbon transition, building on its long-standing emphasis on sustainable development. The Government’s strategy to enable Singapore’s low-carbon transition will have three thrusts.

a. **Transformations in industry, economy, and society**, e.g. more renewable energy, greater energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption.

b. **Adoption of advanced low-carbon technologies**, e.g. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and use of low-carbon hydrogen.

c. **Effective international collaboration**, e.g. international climate action, regional power grids, market-based mechanisms.

In the 30-year time frame to 2050, there will be uncertainties and unanticipated developments. In developing Singapore’s LEDS aspiration, we have taken a positive outlook on global advances in technology and the potential for international co-operation.

**GREEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES**

Singapore will leverage green growth opportunities as it embarks on this low-carbon transition. For example, we aim to become a green finance hub to spur investments in low-carbon solutions and drive climate action in the region. Singapore also aims to develop a circular economy, to enable emissions reduction, open up opportunities for companies, and create new jobs for Singaporeans. Singapore will continue to serve as a “living lab” for companies to test-bed innovative solutions that can be exported globally.

**BUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENCE**

For small island nations like Singapore, climate change poses an asymmetrical challenge. Although its impact on global emissions is small, the effect of climate change on the country is disproportionately large and existential.  Singapore will continue to invest and build up climate science capabilities, and work on adaptation measures such as coastal protection, protecting our biodiversity and greenery, and enhancing our food security.

**SUPPORTING GLOBAL CLIMATE ACTION**


Singapore’s enhanced NDC and LEDS aspiration demonstrates our commitment to support global climate action. Singapore will:

a. Work actively in various international fora such as the UNFCCC to strengthen consensus among countries, especially at a time when the multilateral system is under strain;

b. Support efforts by international organisations, e.g. International Civil Aviation Organization, International Maritime Organization; and

c. Collaborate with international and regional partners such as UNFCCC, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, ASEAN, C40 to enable effective collaboration and exchange best practices.

**EVERYONE MUST PLAY A PART**


Singapore’s strategy for climate action is one that is considered, committed, and collective. Everyone – government, individuals, households, and businesses – must do their part, and work together as a whole-of-nation to achieve Singapore’s goals. As part of Singapore Together, the Government will actively seek opportunities to partner citizens, businesses and civil society to advance climate action. This will secure the future of Singapore as a climate-resilient nation with a competitive economy, sustainable environment, a responsible and active citizenry, and a good quality of life for all.
