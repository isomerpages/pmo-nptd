Parents will receive the enhanced Baby Bonus benefits from 1 Aug 2023, ahead of planned implementation in early 2024.

The enhanced Baby Bonus Scheme, comprising the Baby Bonus Cash Gift (BBCG) and the Child Development Account (CDA), was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong during Budget 2023. Families with eligible Singaporean children born on or after 14 Feb 2023 will receive an increased BBCG with a longer pay-out period and more Government contributions to the CDA. During Budget 2023, the implementation timeline was estimated as early 2024. Since then, agencies have successfully expedited the legislation and system updates necessary to bring forward the implementation timeline to 1 Aug 2023.

Parents with eligible children who are born from 14 Feb 2023 are advised to take note of the payout period and implementation timeline of the enhanced Baby Bonus Scheme. Please refer to the table below for more details.
