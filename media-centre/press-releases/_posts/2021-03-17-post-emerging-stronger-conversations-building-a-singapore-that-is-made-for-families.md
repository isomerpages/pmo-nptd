A series of conversations themed **Building a Singapore that is Made For Families** will run from April to September 2021, and interested participants can register their interest from today. The series, part of the Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversations, aims to better understand individuals’ experiences and thoughts on marriage and parenthood, and how these may have changed due to COVID-19. 

This series of conversations will be led by Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, and Ms Sun Xueling, Minister of State for Social and Family Development, and Education. Together with other political office holders, they aim to engage about 400 people. Participants will get to share their concerns and challenges as they start and raise families, and also exchange ideas to collectively address these challenges.

Minister Indranee said: “Many Singaporeans want to start and raise families. But I know the pandemic has also caused some to rethink their plans. My colleagues and I want to better understand how we can help you to continue with your life plans in spite of the pandemic. Let’s work together to build a society that’s Made for Families.”

To ensure a diversity of views, we hope to have Singaporeans at different stages of their marriage and parenthood journey, and who live in different parts of Singapore, participate in the conversations. All Singaporeans, their partners, and parents of a Singaporean child are welcome to register. For a start, six online sessions will be organised for participants in the following life-stages: 

i.	  those who are dating/ engaged/ married without children;  
ii.	  parents with children aged up to 6 years old; and   
iii.	  parents with children in primary school    

There will also be another online session for those who would like to share their views on issues related to fertility, such as awareness, screening and treatment. Interested parties who wish to take part in the conversations can find more information and register at **[go.gov.sg/families-convo](https://go.gov.sg/families-convo) from 17 March 2021**. Shortlisted participants will be notified about **two weeks** before the start of each conversation.

This series of conversations is jointly organised by the National Population and Talent Division in the Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Social and Family Development, and the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth.
