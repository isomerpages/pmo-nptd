Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Grace Fu joined 6,200 Singaporeans living, working and studying in Australia at The Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney for Singapore Day 2013 to “Celebrate Singapore, Our Home”<sup>1</sup> today.

"We want to make sure that we continue to reach out to all Singaporeans including our Singaporeans who are overseas - working, studying and living. Singapore Day is important because it helps all of us to remain connected with families, with friends and with Singapore," DPM Teo said in his opening address at the event.

Singapore Day provides an opportunity for Singaporeans abroad to network and update themselves on Singapore.

Participants enjoyed familiar tastes, sights and sounds of home including authentic hawker food such as char kway teow, laksa, satay and chilli crab. They also updated themselves on developments in the education landscape, the vibrant sports scene, the latest public housing initiatives and career opportunities back home.

‘Singapore Boy’ Hossan Leong, The Noose’s Chua En-lai and Alaric Tay, Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd’s Gurmit Singh and Irene Ang, funny man Mark Lee, singercomposer Dick Lee, Olivia Ong, Melbourne-based music maestro Charlie Lim and local indie band Cashew Chemists provided entertainment with their distinctive local flavour.

Singapore Day is a collaborative effort by OSU and its partners from the public, people and private sectors. It is held annually in major cities where there are a significant number of Singaporeans. Singapore Days have been held in New York (2007), Melbourne (2008), London (2009), Shanghai (2011) and New York (2012).

**Quotes from Singapore Day participants:**

_Overseas Singaporeans_

“Singapore Day was great – a taste of home! It really feels like Singapore here in the middle of the Royal Botanic Gardens.” – Serinder Athwal

“It is enjoyable to come together with Singaporeans to reminisce out time back home. I wish there are more events like this!” – Michelle Ng

“It was a good opportunity to meet friends who came to Sydney from other states just for this event.” – Yao XinYuan

_Concert artiste_

"The connections that our overseas Singaporeans make with each other when they meet are really heart-warming to see. New friendships are made, old bonds renewed. It's about reconnecting with the Singaporeans whom we know as family and friends, and whom we know will remain intrinsically Singaporean." – Local artiste Hossan Leong, who is a fourth-time participant at Singapore Day.

_Hawkers_

“I am very happy to be a part of Singapore Day 2013. It all started when my father was first invited to participate in the event two years ago. He was really excited about meeting and interacting with Singaporeans overseas. His dedication to Singapore Day was inspiring. It meant a lot for him to be able to bring our Nasi Lemak and a taste of home to our fellow Singaporeans overseas, putting smiles on their faces as they satisfy their cravings for local hawker food. My father is no longer with us but I am here today to be in his place. Like him, I am glad to have been given the opportunity to be a part of this.” - Abdul Malik Hassan, owner of Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak, a third-time participant at Singapore Day

**WELCOME REMARKS BY MR TEO CHEE HEAN, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER IN-CHARGE OF NATIONAL POPULATION AND TALENT DIVISION AT SINGAPORE DAY 2013, 12 OCTOBER 2013, THE DOMAIN, ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA**

Good afternoon, everyone. It is a great pleasure to see so many of you here this afternoon, gathered together in Sydney to celebrate all things that are Singapore.

First of all, I would like to recognize my colleague Ms Grace Fu who is also here with us, and also High Commissioner Mike Teo, and also an old colleague of mine from the SAF.

I have been having a good visit here in Australia. One purpose of my visit was to touch base with the new Australian government and over the last two days, I have had the opportunity to meet the six members of the Cabinet including Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss.

I also had a very good site visit yesterday to our ship RSS Endeavour which has been in Australia in Sydney for the last one week taking part in the international fleet review. She left port at 6pm yesterday, headed for home, eagerly waiting to get home in 12 days’ time.

This is our sixth Singapore Day. The first we held in New York City in 2007 and the second in Melbourne in 2008. We’ve had Singapore Day in several other cities, including Shanghai and London. This year, we are back in Australia, in Sydney.

Singapore Day is important because it helps all of us to remain connected with families, with friends and with Singapore. This year has been an interesting and important year.

**A New Way Forward**

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made an important speech at the National Day Rally this year. He spoke basically about three things which Singaporeans are very concerned about, which are housing, healthcare and education.

On the housing front, he announced several initiatives which would give high assurance to Singaporeans that they will be able to afford housing in Singapore.

On the healthcare front, he made a number of announcements which included extending Medishield to all Singaporeans regardless of age including those with pre-existing medical conditions.

In education, he also made some announcements to make the education system more flexible, more accessible, and also easier for Singaporeans to continue to upgrade themselves throughout their lives in a variety of new institutions in Singapore.

**Building a Strong Singaporean Community**

What is important for this occasion is that we want to make sure that we continue to reach out to all Singaporeans including our Singaporeans who are overseas - working, studying and living.

There are two new mobile services which you can make use of to stay in touch. One is Toggle SG+ and this provides news and access to your favourite shows on-the-go.

The second is iContactSG (pronounced as “I-Contact-S-G”) and this helps to provide industry updates and also, updates on job opportunities and other happenings in Singapore.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for being here to join in today and also to our many partners from the people, private and public sectors. I would also like to give a big thank you to all our friends who have been working very hard to provide us with what brings us all together, and that’s food.

There are three parts of our Singapore Day. The first is food, the second is fun and entertainment with our friends Hossan (Leong) and others, and third, is the booths out here, which help to update ourselves on what is happening in Singapore - to help you to remain connected to Singapore and reintegrate when you go come home.

Once again, thank you very much for your presence here. We want to keep in touch with you, and let’s all stay connected with family, friends and with Singapore.

Enjoy yourselves! Thank you very much.

**TRANSCRIPT OF DPM TEO’S DOORSTOP INTERVIEW**

**TRANSCRIPT OF DPM’s DOORSTOP AT SINGAPORE DAY 2013 IN SYDNEY
12 OCTOBER 2013**

**What is the significance of organising Singapore Day?**

I’m very glad that we are organising Singapore Day in Sydney. We have a very large group of overseas Singaporeans in Australia and in particular, in Sydney. We held our first Singapore Day six years ago and all the Singapore Days we’ve held since then have been very welcomed by our overseas Singaporeans. It helps to reach out and helps all of us to stay connected to family, friends and home.

**What did you gather from the people you have spoken to?**

There were a few things. Many are still attached to Singapore. A good number of them came dressed in red and white. It is very good to see. They all enjoyed the food. I think they also enjoyed the opportunity to connect with one another. They found the exhibits useful, to update them on what’s happening in Singapore.

**With more Singaporeans moving overseas, how important is it to keep them connected to Singapore?**

This is part of the globalised world. There are more Singaporeans who work and study overseas and also because more Singaporean companies are overseas. It’s good to have Singaporeans who have overseas experiences. But we hope that all Singaporeans overseas will stay connected and still feel a part of Singapore. So Singapore Day helps us to reach out to Singaporeans overseas.

There are other ways of doing so. Technology helps. For example we now have Toggle SG+ and that provides updates, news and even your favourite TV programmes. iContactSG brings you up-to-date news on job opportunities and the latest happenings in Singapore.

Even though there are more Singaporeans overseas, there are more ways they can stay connected.

**Is the Government going to do more to reach out to these Singaporeans?**

It is a two-way street. When Singaporeans go overseas, they also want to keep in contact with what’s happening in Singapore. The number of Singaporeans here in Australia and in the Sydney region who have come forward to take part in Singapore Day very enthusiastically is an indication that they too want to keep in touch with Singaporeans. We’re very happy to see that Singapore Day is welcomed by our Singaporeans here. And also by the families of our overseas Singaporeans back home, who are happy that we are reaching out to them. In fact, I met many Singaporeans who tell me where they live in Singapore, or that their parents had met me in Singapore before.

**Any new initiatives in the pipeline to keep them connected to Singapore?**

As I said we have many opportunities such as the Toggle SG+, which provides news and favourite TV programmes. There is also a mobile app, iContactSG, which provides avenues for job opportunities and latest developments in Singapore.

**Comments about the Singapore Day 2013 turnout?**

I think it is a very good turnout. What’s important also, is that we’ve had a lot of participation from the Singaporeans here in Australia. We have 180 volunteers who helped to put the occasion together. You can see them all around helping out at the site. There are also more opportunities for Singaporeans here to take part. There are opportunities for them to write down their New Year wishes on these floating balls, which will then be put on Marina Bay on New Year’s Day. They can donate to the Community Chest online. They can send their good wishes to Team Singapore. There’s also the Singer-porean contest, which I think is very good. So there’s more participation.

**As more Singaporeans move overseas, are you worried that the Singapore identity will be diluted?**

So, on the one hand, while globalisation brings more Singaporeans overseas, globalisation and technology itself helps us to keep connected. The important thing is what you have in your heart. And I think certainly from Singaporeans in Singapore, we want to reach out to Singaporeans overseas because many of them are our family and friends. And it’s good that Singaporeans overseas themselves also want to remain in contact.

**Do you have a message to Singaporeans in Australia?**

I want to wish all our overseas Singaporeans in Australia all the very best in their studies and their work. And to stay connected with families, with friends and with home. I wish you all good health and happiness.

我们可以看到似乎有越来越多的新加坡人在外。您怎么看待这样的一个趋势呢？

因为我们的教育程度相当地高，所以很多 程度相当地高，所以很多社会能容易地收入我们的新加坡人，而新加 坡人在国外也有一些机遇。这是件好事情，我希望他们在国外发展的当儿，不要忘记 祖国，能继续跟国家保持联系，继续跟进我们在政策上的改变，特别是他们想到要回 国的时候，我们希望能够帮助他们 希望能够帮助他们更好地、更快地再次融入新加坡的社会。

有什么样的方法能让他们跟新加坡联系呢？
