In his speech in Parliament on 27 Feb 2008, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng announced that Singapore Day 2008 will be organised in Melbourne in Oct 2008.

This event would allow Overseas Singaporeans in Australia a chance to get updated on the many exciting developments in Singapore, and rekindle and renew their connection with home.

This follows the very positive response from the 6,000 Overseas Singaporeans at the inaugural Singapore Day held in New York on 21 April 2007.
