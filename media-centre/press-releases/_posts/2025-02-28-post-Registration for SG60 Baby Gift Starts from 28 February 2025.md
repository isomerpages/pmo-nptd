<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To commemorate Singapore’s
60<sup>th</sup> year of independence, all Singapore Citizen babies born
in 2025 will receive an SG60 Baby Gift to celebrate their birth. The Gift
signifies the Government’s commitment to support Singaporeans in realising
their marriage and parenthood aspirations, as well as the importance of
the next generation in ensuring Singapore’s future remains vibrant and
full of opportunities.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SG60 Baby Gift comprises ten specially
curated items, which are intended to support the child’s initial growth
and development and encourage family bonding. Each SG60 Baby Gift will
also come with a congratulatory letter from Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
Refer to <a href="/files/media-centre/press-releases/Annex_A_SG60.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Annex A</u> </a>for
details of the items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of efforts to rally
Singaporeans to contribute to the SG60 celebrations, we partnered students
from LASALLE College of the Arts to design the artwork on the SG60 Baby
Gift items. The artwork features SG60 babies and iconic Singaporean landmarks,
to evoke a sense of fresh beginnings and hope for the future.</p>
