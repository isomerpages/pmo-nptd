Overseas Singaporeans in China will enjoy a slice of home at Singapore Day 2011. To be held at Century Park, Pudong District, Shanghai on 16 April, Singapore Day will enable Overseas Singaporeans to “re-live” and “reconnect” with home through an exciting line-up of Singaporean hawker favourites, local entertainment and a showcase on the latest developments in Singapore.

Besides performances by familiar TV personalities, Singapore Day 2011 will also see community participation with performances by primary school children. Students from Zhenghua Primary will take to the stage with a fusion dance while homegrown superstar Kit Chan will serenade the audience with her signature song, Home. Mr Goh Boon Teck, Creative Director of Singapore Day 2011, said, “Singapore is a young nation with many colourful offerings and achievements. Through Singapore Day, let’s enjoy the spirit of being Singaporean in a fun-filled day fair, celebrate the excellence of Singapore, and appreciate our vibrant and colourful home. ”

Singapore Day 2011 will also bring a personal touch and connection with home through the airing of recorded video greetings from family and friends. Young Singaporeans can get to try their hands at local games such as capteh, five stones, pick-up sticks and chongkat at the Kids’ Zone - a play area specially for children. Students from the Nanyang Girls’ High School will be on hand to give them pointers on how these games are played. In addition, children will also be able to play in a ball pool shaped like a traditional ice-kacang machine. Mr Yap Chee Gee, a Singaporean who is based in Shanghai, will walk the grounds dressed as a clown and entertain them with thrilling performances and balloon sculpting.

In addition, a series of interactive multi-media showcases will profile various facets of life in Singapore and update Singaporeans on exciting developments back home.

Singapore Day is, of course, never complete without local food. This year, Singapore Day 2011 will ensure that Overseas Singaporeans get their fill of Singaporean delights, including the unique Eurasian and Peranakan delights such as Devil’s Curry, Ayam Buah Keluak, together with all-time favourites such as chilli crab, satay, roti prata and teh tarik.

“Singapore Day 2011 is a joint effort of the private, public and people sectors. It is an event by Singaporeans for Singaporeans, to connect us all with home. We look forward to bringing a slice of home to Singaporeans living in Shanghai and nearby cities on 16 April,” said Ms Amy Hing, Deputy Secretary, National Population and Talent Division.

Singapore Day is a signature event to engage Overseas Singaporeans and help them stay connected with home and with each other. It is held in cities with a significant number of Overseas Singaporeans. There are an estimated 20,000 Singaporeans in China, with about 10,000 living in and around Shanghai.
