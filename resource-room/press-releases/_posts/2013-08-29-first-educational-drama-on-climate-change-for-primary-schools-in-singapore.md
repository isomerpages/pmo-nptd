**Singapore, 29 August 2013 -** The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has launched a new educational drama on climate change for primary schools as part of its outreach efforts to raise awareness and to encourage individual action on climate change among youths in Singapore.

Entitled "Stop Melting My Home", the drama features Piqa the polar bear from the Arctic and her friends Junie and Benny in Singapore. It introduces the issue of climate change to young students in an engaging and easy-to-understand way. The drama aims to explain the cause and effect of climate change, and equip students with practical tips on what they can do at home and in school to address climate change e.g. by saving energy, travelling green and practicing the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle). The 30-minute drama includes an interactive quiz session to engage students and teachers. Performed by theatrical company The Voice Productions, the drama made its debut at Bukit Timah Primary School on 1 August 2013. NCCS has plans to take it to some 120 primary schools by end 2014.

NCCS has also produced supplementary materials to support the drama, namely, an information booklet for students and a teachers' resource kit. The students' guide, entitled "My Guide to Climate Change: Getting to Know Climate Change with Piqa, Benny & Junie", reiterates key messages from the drama and serves as a takeaway resource for students. It contains in-depth information which covers climate science, tips to address climate change, as well as activities customised for children to make the booklet useful and interesting for students.

The teachers' resource kit includes suggested projects and activities that can be conducted in the classroom, as well as online reference materials. The teaching aids and lesson plans are intended to assist and encourage teachers to include the topic of climate change in the classrooms and to engage students in learning about climate change.

Mr Yuen Sai Kuan, Director, 3P Network, NCCS said, "The programme is specially designed so that young students can learn about climate change in a fun and interactive way. Through presenting climate change in a drama skit, we hope to draw the children's attention on the consequences of human activities on our climate and inspire them to take action from an early age. We also hope that the drama will encourage more schools to develop programmes for their students to contribute positively to address climate change."

Mdm Suriya Amin, an English and Mathematics teacher from Bukit Timah Primary School, said, "The show is meaningful as it raises awareness among pupils on climate change and it helps them understand their role in preserving our climate."

Ms Kanmani, teacher-in-charge of Concord Primary School's Environmental Club said, "Students were able to see the relationship between human actions and consequences on the climate. The show also goes well with our schoolâ€™s efforts in teaching students eco-friendly practices, such as recycling, saving water and reducing energy usage."

Mrs Tonnine Chua, Principal, Concord Primary School, said, "Climate change is a big issue that can be hard for younger children to grasp. Judging from the reactions of our students, the drama programme was able to effectively engage them and enhance their interest in the topic."
