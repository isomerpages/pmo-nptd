_Short films to rally support for Climate Change action_

2015 is a key milestone for international action on climate change as a new agreement will be made in Paris at the end of the year. To galvanise public support for climate change action as Singapore prepares for the new agreement, the National Climate Change Competition 2015 was launched today to seek out videos that will help Singaporeans understand the importance of the issue and the urgent need for action. Winning entries from the competition will be considered for use in a public education campaign.

The theme for this year’s competition, “Our Climate, Our Choice”, highlights the close connection between our daily choices and climate change. For example, we contribute to climate change whenever we consume electricity as the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity releases Earth-warming gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By conserving electricity, we can help slow down climate change.

“Through this competition, we hope to show Singaporeans that addressing climate change can be as simple as switching off the lights when you no longer need them. We can learn some lessons from our pioneer generation in this respect on how to reduce our carbon footprint by consuming only what we need, conserving resources and finding ways to reuse items where possible,” said Mr Yuen Sai Kuan, Director of Corporate Affairs Division from the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS).

Some examples of climate-friendly habits that we can learn from the pioneer generation include the use of tingkats (food carriers) when ordering food from hawkers, walking or cycling if we need to make short trips and drying laundry outdoors instead of using electric clothes dryers.

Students and members of the public can register to take part in the competition under the following categories at [www.nccs.gov.sg](http://www.nccs.gov.sg/) by 4 May 2015.

(i) Schools Category

* Primary Schools

Participants can stand to win up to $5,000 in cash prizes. Four ‘Viewers’ Choice’ awards will also be given to the most popular videos from the Schools and Open categories. A public voting exercise on NCCS’ Climate Change SG Facebook page will be held to determine the four most popular videos. Details of the competition are at [Annex.](https://github.com/isomerpages/isomerpages-stratgroup/raw/master/images/Press%20Release%20images/PDFs/annex_nccc.pdf)
