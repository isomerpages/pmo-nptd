To commemorate Singapore’s Golden Jubilee in 2015, the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) will be leading a community initiative to develop a celebratory Jubilee Baby Gift to be given to all Singaporeans born next year.

Following the SG50 Steering Committee’s call for celebration ideas in January, NPTD consulted our stakeholders and conducted focus groups with Singaporeans who expressed their wish to celebrate the nation’s 50th Anniversary with a commemorative gift from the current generation of Singaporeans to those born in the Jubilee Year.

**Launch of Public Engagement**

As the Gift is symbolic of what Singaporeans wish to give to the next generation, NPTD would like to involve as many Singaporeans as possible in determining the items to be included in The Jubilee Baby Gift.

NPTD is launching a public engagement campaign from 1 April to 15 May 2014, which will take place in two phases:

Phase I: Call for Suggestions

From the 1st of April till 15 April 2014, Singaporeans can submit their ideas on the items they would like to see included in The Jubilee Baby Gift. They can do so via several channels:

  Phase II: Selecting gift items 

In phase two of the process (18 April – 15 May 2014), NPTD will collate all contributed suggestions and curate them in consultation with our Advisory Panel comprising people-sector and community representatives (see Annex A for more information on our Advisory Panel). We will then publish a shortlist of Singaporeans’ top suggestions on The Jubilee Baby Gift Microsite and at The Jubilee Baby Gift Feedback Booths. The public can then further select the most meaningful items they think should be included in The Jubilee Baby Gift.

“The Jubilee Baby Gift is our special way of saying ’Welcome!’ to our babies born in 2015, a year of great significance to Singapore. To make it a meaningful gift, Singaporeans should be the ones deciding what should go into the Gift. Ideas from Singaporeans will make The Jubilee Baby Gift a uniquely Singaporean keepsake for soon-to-be-born citizens. I can’t wait to see what Gift will welcome our babies in 2015,” says Ms Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources.

**ANNEX A**

**BACKGROUNDER ON THE JUBILEE BABY GIFT ADVISORY PANEL**

While the NPTD engages Singaporeans widely on their ideas for The Jubilee Baby Gift, it has appointed an Advisory Panel to ensure that the community’s suggestions are suitable and resonate with the parents of the newborns who will receive the Gift in 2015.

The Advisory Panel comprises representatives from the people sector who work closely with organisations linked to parents, families and children. They will curate the Singaporeans’ suggestions arising from the public engagement, and will advise on the suitability of the items and the design of The Jubilee Baby Gift.

The bios of the panel members are attached below.
