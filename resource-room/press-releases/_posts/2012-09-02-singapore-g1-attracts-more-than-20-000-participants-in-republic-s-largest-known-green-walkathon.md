_DPM Teo Chee Hean launches “Our Green Home” nationwide roving climate change exhibition_

**Singapore, 2 September 2012 –** Singapore’s largest environmentally-sustainable lifestyle event, Singapore G1 2012, attracted more than 20,000 people to the Marina Barrage today, making it Singapore’s biggest ever walk-for-green event known to date with its record participation numbers.

Organised by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC), the Singapore G1 2012 was officiated by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs and Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC). At the event, DPM Teo also launched the climate change exhibition, “Our Green Home”, organised by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS).The event brought together partners from People, Public and Private (3P) sectors.

DPM Teo said, “Addressing climate change well will contribute to Singapore's continued competitiveness and sustained growth, and help provide a good living environment for everyone. It requires a whole-of-nation approach, with active participation by businesses, households and people, working hand-in-hand with the Government. As the climate change exhibition travels to various parts of Singapore, we hope that it will inspire more people to take steps to address climate change as part of our daily lives.”

The exhibition by NCCS, “Our Green Home”, provides information on Singapore’s climate change plans, highlights the opportunities arising from climate change and the importance of individual and community actions to address climate change. The exhibition incorporates a Partnership Corner where selected People, Public and Private (3P) sector partners will showcase their initiatives and projects as examples of the diverse ground-up efforts on climate change. Following the launch, the NCCS-2012 exhibition will rove to selected libraries, community clubs and shopping malls in the heartlands, from September 2012 to January 2013. Please refer to the factsheet at Annex A for more information on the NCCS-2012 exhibition. Information updates are also available on the event Facebook page,

**Singapore G1 2012** 
“We have worked very hard and closely with our partners to put together Singapore G1 2012 - the nation’s largest environmentally-sustainable lifestyle event. The aim of the SEC’s Singapore G1 2012 was to reach out to as many people as possible, from across various sectors. Today, we were able to get our messages across to a large number of people in a fun and memorable way, reinforcing the fact that everyone can play a part in reducing their carbon footprint,” said Mr Jose Raymond, Executive Director of the SEC.

Singapore G1 2012 featured two five-kilometre walkathon routes, the North and East Walkathon, which started at Lavender and Stadium MRT Stations and was flagged off by Mr Mr Jose Raymond, Executive Director of the SEC and Dr Teo Ho Pin, Vice-Chairman of the SEC and Mayor, Northwest District respectively. The New Paper Big Walk – which started at The Central above Clarke Quay MRT Station and ended at the Marina Barrage – was also held in conjunction with the Singapore G1 2012 walkathon. Please refer to Annex B for details on the walkathon routes.

The Singapore G1 2012 is a distinctive event and its theme – Live Green – highlights the link between the protection of the environment with healthy living and the reduction of carbon footprint. The event was planned with a “zero waste” objective to show event organisers and corporations that it is possible for events to be carbon neutral and generate as little waste as possible. “There are literally thousands of events which are organised in Singapore – from sports events to conferences, among many others. The key for event organisers, and we have proven it through the Singapore G1 2012, is to organise their events as carbon neutral as possible and to ensure that as little waste as possible is generated. The Singapore G1 2012 has also proven that going green need not involve a compromise in creativity,” said Mr Raymond.

The event’s marketing and branding also entailed minimal usage of posters and banners. Recycling bins were heavily utilised during the event to ensure that water bottles used by participants were recycled, and SEC put in place independent auditors to verify the amount of waste generated and recycled from the event.

A string of exciting activities were available for all to experience and enjoy at the Marina Barrage including green music performances, a soapbox competition called the Young Champions Challenge which included youth-at-risk, a Green Art installation comprising 2,500 aluminium cans by students from the Singapore University of Technology and Design and a ‘Live Green’ photography contest.

A smartphone application was also developed in partnership with A*Star SIMTECH, SMRT Corporation Ltd. and Balanced Consultancy, the developers of the app. Apart from the usual time and distance calculation that is already available, the app calculates the reduction in carbon footprint, calories burnt and dollars saved per capita by walking, cycling, jogging or taking public transportation, as compared to driving.

The public also had the opportunity to try out the new Nissan LEAF at the Marina Barrage. It is the world’s first mass-produced 100% electric vehicle, which does not produce any tailpipe pollution or greenhouse gas emissions during operation. The vehicle served as the environmentally-friendly transport ambassador for the event. This was made possible by Tan Chong Motor Sales’ support of SEC’s objectives to create a lasting impact on climate change by collaborating with people, industries and governments to encourage and achieve sustainable urbanisation.
