**Singapore, 19 February 2013 -** The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) launched the National Climate Change Competition (NCCC) 2013 to invite students to submit short videos to inspire Singaporeans to take action to address climate change. At the launch event, Mr Niam Chiang Meng, Permanent Secretary (National Climate Change), also presented prizes to the winning teams of the NCCC 2012 Technology Project Challenge.

**National Climate Change Competition (NCCC) 2013**

The NCCC, into its third year, is part of NCCS’ outreach efforts to generate climate change awareness and action among youths in Singapore. Mr Niam said, “The competition is an important avenue for students to express their ideas on climate change-related issues. It also builds environmental stewardship among young Singaporeans. I am pleased that many of our youths are keen to contribute their ideas and make a difference. Through the NCCC 2013, we hope to tap on our youths’ creativity to come up with new ideas to tackle climate change and to spread the message through short videos.” 

The NCCC 2013 will build on the strong interest displayed by youths in the NCCC 2012 Short Film Challenge . It is supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the National Youth Achievement Award Council (NYAA) and Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP). The competition theme “Be the Change. It Starts with You.” conveys the message that youths play an important role in inspiring and influencing their peers to take individual actions to address climate change. It is also the objective of the competition for youths to gain a better understanding of climate change, its impact and how everyone can play a part. 

The NCCC 2013 is open to primary, secondary, junior college, institute of technical education, polytechnic and university students. Participants need to produce videos of less than three minutes on the competition theme. The closing date for submission of entries is 19 August 2013. Participants will be able to benefit from a special seminar conducted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic to equip them with knowledge on story creation and film production techniques. 

Prizes will be awarded to the top three videos in each category and a ‘Viewers’ Choice’ (‘Most Popular Video’). Teams will be assessed based on the strength of content, creativity and balance between artistic and technical skill, and execution in relation to the competition theme. A public voting exercise for the ‘Most Popular Video’ will be conducted on NCCS’ Climate Change SG Facebook page. The shortlisted videos in each category will be announced on the Climate Change SG Facebook page (www.facebook.com/ClimateChangeSG) in September 2013. The winning entries will be announced and showcased at an award ceremony in November 2013.
