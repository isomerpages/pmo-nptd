**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
ORAL ANSWER  
MONDAY, 13 AUGUST 2012**

**Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap:**  
To ask the Prime Minister (a) in each of the years from 2004 to 2011, what percentage of companies offered paternity leave and what is the median length of such leave offered; and (b) whether the Government will consider it timely to legislate for paternity leave of at least six days.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**  
Based on the latest Conditions of Employment Survey by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), about 48% of companies with at least 25 employees offered paternity leave in 2010.  This figure has been gradually increasing, from 40% in 2004, to 43% in 2006 and to 47% in 2008.  MOM does not collect data on the median length of paternity leave offered. 

The Government is currently reviewing policies and measures to support marriage and parenthood.  As part of the review, we have been engaging various stakeholders to discuss new ideas and enhancements to existing measures.  We will take all suggestions into consideration, including the introduction of paternity leave.
