**TWELFTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
(FIRST SESSION)  
WRITTEN ANSWER  
MONDAY, 9 JANUARY 2012**  


#### **REASONS FOR EMIGRATION**

**Mr Pritam Singh:**
To ask the Prime Minister how many Singaporeans gave up their citizenship from 2000 to 2010 and whether the Government has devised strategies to address the reasons why Singaporeans decide to emigrate.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):** 
From 2000 to 2010, an average of about 1,000 Singaporeans renounced their citizenship annually. The reasons for emigration vary. Some indicated that they prefer a different living environment, whilst others emigrated due to their marriage to foreigners or to reunite with family members overseas.

Our focus is on ensuring that Singapore remains the best home for all Singaporeans. Beyond developing an attractive living environment and a thriving economy which sustains good jobs for our people, we also seek to strengthen the bonds that Singaporeans have with one another and with the country.

We will also continue to engage Singaporeans studying and working abroad. Through efforts such as the Overseas Singaporean Unitâ€™s programmes, we hope to help this group maintain strong ties with Singapore, to facilitate their eventual return.
