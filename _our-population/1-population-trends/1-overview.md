Nonetheless, resident total fertility rate remained below the replacement rate of 2.1 – at 1.14 in 2019 and the year before. This is due partly to a larger cohort of young Singaporeans (aged 20 – 30 in 2018) – many of whom are children of baby boomers1 – who are entering the peak childbearing age, but have not yet had children. The median age of first-time mothers has also increased from 28.5 years in 2000 to 30.6 years in 2019.
