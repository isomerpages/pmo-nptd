Singapore’s total population stands at 5.69 million as of June 2020, which decreased slightly by 0.3 per cent from June 2019 to June 2020. Overall, total population growth rate over the past five years was slower compared to the previous five-year period.

Singapore’s citizen population grew by 0.6 per cent to 3.52 million as of June 2020, through more citizen births, and a selective immigration policy. The number of new citizens and new PRs granted every year has remained stable at an average of about 22,100 citizens and 31,700 PRs per year, from 2015 to 2019. The size of the permanent resident population has also remained stable at around half a million.

The non-resident population decreased by 2.1 per cent to reach 1.6 million, as of June 2020. There was a decrease in foreign employment from June 2019 to June 2020, mainly in Services. By pass type, the decrease in foreign employment was mainly driven by a decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders. These trends were largely due to COVID-19 related challenges, brought about by weak demand and travel restrictions.

With increasing life expectancy and low fertility rates, the proportion of Singapore’s citizen population aged 65 and above is rising, and at a faster pace compared to the last decade.

More Singaporeans are starting families. On average, more citizens got married in the five-year period between 2015 and 2019 (23, 600 each year), compared to 22,400 between 2010 and 2014.

Singapore welcomed 32,844 citizen births in 2019. On average, more citizen babies were born between 2015 and 2019 (32,900 on average each year) than between 2010 and 2014 (31,700 on average each year).

However, resident Total Fertility Rate remained below the replacement rate of 2.1 at 1.14 in 2019, which is the same as the year before. This is partly due to later marriages and subsequent childbearing. The median age of first-time mothers increased from 28.5 years in 2000 to 30.6 years in 2019.
