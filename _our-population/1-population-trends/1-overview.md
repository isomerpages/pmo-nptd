Singapore’s total population stands at 5.69 million as of June 2020, which decreased slightly by 0.3% from June 2019 to June 2020. Overall, total population growth rate over the past five years was slower compared to the previous five-year period.

Singapore’s citizen population grew by 0.6 per cent to 3.52 million as of June 2020, through more citizen births, and a selective immigration policy. The permanent resident population has remained stable at around half a million over the past five years.

The non-resident population decreased by 2.1% to reach 1.6 million, as of June 2020. There was a decrease in foreign employment from June 2019 to June 2020, mainly in Services. By pass type, the decrease in foreign employment was mainly driven by a decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders. These trends were largely due to COVID-19 related challenges, brought about by weak demand and travel restrictions.

More Singaporeans are starting families. On average, more citizens got married in the five-year period between 2015 and 2019 (23.6K each year), compared to 22.4K between 2010 and 2014.

Nonetheless, resident total fertility rate remained below the replacement rate of 2.1 at 1.14 in 2019 and the year before. This is due partly to a delay in marriages and subsequently childbearing. The median age of first-time mothers has also increased from 28.5 years in 2000 to 30.6 years in 2019.
