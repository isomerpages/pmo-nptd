**Marriage and Parenthood Trends**

Globally, many developed societies have seen birth rates declining since the 1970s. Singapore’s total fertility rate (TFR)  was 1.14 in 2019.

In the short-term, TFR can be affected by factors such as economic uncertainty, and demographic trends. In the long-term, TFR trends are influenced by social norms and values, and attitudes toward marriage and parenthood. Economic development and improvements in education and work opportunities for women also influence societal attitudes toward singlehood, marriage, and parenthood. 

We regularly monitor emerging and enduring trends to better understand how they impact Singaporeans’ attitudes towards marriage and parenthood.
 
Despite our low TFR, there is reason to be hopeful as more Singaporeans are starting families. On average, more citizens got married in the last five years (2015-2019) than between 2010 and 2014.

On average, there were also more citizen babies born between 2015 and 2019, than the preceding five-year period (2010 – 2014).

Young Singaporeans have consistently expressed a strong desire to get married and have children. The 2016 Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Survey showed that 83% of single Millennials (aged 21-35) surveyed want to get married, and 92% of married Millennials surveyed want to have at least two children.

**Support for Marriage & Parenthood**

Supporting Singaporeans in fulfilling their plans to get married and raise families is a key national priority. Through close partnership across Government agencies, and with community partners, employers and the larger society, a wide range of support is available to Singaporeans at every stage of their marriage and parenthood journey.  

The **Marriage & Parenthood Package** provides comprehensive support for families in a wide range of areas – from caregiving needs and child-raising costs to the living environment. In recent years, more efforts have been made to increase the accessibility and affordability of preschool, housing, healthcare for children, and fertility treatments. 

There is now more support than before for parents to better manage their work and family responsibilities through the provision of flexible work arrangements. Employers and co-workers are also showing more support towards cultivating family-friendly workplaces. 

To further improve work-life harmony in Singapore, a Citizens’ Panel, comprising Singaporeans from various walks of life, was convened in 2019. Initiatives recommended by the panel to promote FWAs, improve HR practices and social norms are now in the pipeline. Details can be found [here](https://www.ideas.gov.sg/public/CitizensPanel_WorkLifeHarmony). We will continue to work with fellow Singaporeans on ways to address marriage and parenthood issues.

To assure families of support from the government and the community, we have also launched the *Made For Families initiative* in June 2020. Businesses, organisations and community groups can adopt the *Made For Families* brand mark to identify themselves as promoting the value of family in our society. Government programmes that help couples marry, start and bring up their families will also be identified as reasons why Singapore is *Made for Families*. More details on *Made For Families* can be found [here](https://www.heybaby.sg/PlayAPart/MadeForFamilies).
