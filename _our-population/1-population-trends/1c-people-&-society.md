A strong and cohesive Singapore society is one that also embraces diversity. Singapore has a rich history of welcoming people of different cultures and backgrounds; and many of us can trace our ancestry beyond these shores.

This coexistence and intermixing of cultures continues today. In 2018, about 1 in 5 citizen marriages last year were inter-ethnic<sup>1</sup>, and more than 1 in 3 citizen marriages involved transnational<sup>2</sup> couples.

Immigration remains a delicate issue in many places around the world. In Singapore, the numbers are carefully controlled – between 2015-2019, about 22,100 new Singapore citizenships (SC) and about 31,700 Permanent Residencies (PR) were granted on average each year. The total size of the PR population has remained stable at around half a million. 

The number of SCs granted also includes citizenships for children born overseas to Singaporean parents. These children made up about 1,600 of new SCs granted each year.

The exact number of new SC/ PRs granted each year depends on several factors, including the number and quality of applications we receive, the pace of integration of new immigrants and our changing needs.

Every application for SC/ PR is evaluated holistically to assess the applicant’s ability to integrate in and contribute to Singapore, and their commitment to sinking roots here. Various markers of integration are considered, such as applicants’ family ties to Singaporeans, length of residency here, and whether they have studied in our national schools or completed National Service. Other factors considered include the applicant's economic contributions, qualifications and age.

New citizens must make the effort to fit in. To help them along, we have a [National Integration Council (NIC)](https://www.nationalintegrationcouncil.gov.sg/), which supports initiatives such as the [Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ)](https://www.nationalintegrationcouncil.gov.sg/citizenship/singapore-citizenship-journey) run by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and the People’s Association. All naturalised citizens go through the SCJ to understand Singapore’s history, norms and values, and in the process build stronger ties with the local community. MCCY has invited Singaporeans to join the [Citizen’s Workgroup for SCJ](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sector/initiatives/citizens-workgroup-for-singapore-citizenship-journey) to explore, discuss and create content that will be used to update the SCJ.

When everyone across all levels of society gets involved, that’s when integration will be most effective, sustainable and rewarding for Singapore.
