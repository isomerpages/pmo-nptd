A strong and cohesive Singapore society is one that also embraces diversity. Singapore has a rich history of welcoming people of different cultures and backgrounds; and many Singaporeans can trace their ancestry beyond the country’s shores.

The coexistence and intermixing of cultures continue today. In 2019, about 1 in 5 citizen marriages were inter-ethnic<sup>1</sup>, and more than 1 in 3 citizen marriages involved transnational<sup>2</sup> couples.

Immigration is a delicate matter around the world. In Singapore, the number of immigrants are carefully managed. Between 2015 and 2019, 22,000 new Singapore citizenships (SC) and 32,000 Permanent Residencies (PR) were granted on average each year. The total size of the PR population has remained stable at around half a million. 

The number of citizenships granted also includes those for children born overseas to Singaporean parents. These children made up about 1,600 of the new citizenships granted each year. 

The exact number of new SC/ PRs granted each year depends on several factors, including the number and quality of applications received, and our changing needs. 

Every application for SC/ PR is evaluated holistically to assess the applicant’s ability to integrate in and contribute to Singapore, and their commitment to sinking roots here. Various markers of integration are considered, such as applicants’ family ties to Singaporeans, length of residency here, and whether they have studied in Singapore schools or completed National Service. Other factors considered include the applicant's economic contributions, qualifications and age.

New citizens must make the effort to fit in. To help them along, the [National Integration Council (NIC)](https://www.nationalintegrationcouncil.gov.sg/) supports initiatives such as the [Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ)](https://www.nationalintegrationcouncil.gov.sg/citizenship/singapore-citizenship-journey), a collaboration between the [Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/), the [People’s Association (PA)](https://www.pa.gov.sg/) and the [Immigrations & Checkpoints Authority (ICA)](https://www.ica.gov.sg). All naturalised citizens go through the SCJ to understand Singapore’s history, norms and values, and in the process build stronger ties with the community. Singaporeans were invited to join the [Citizen’s Workgroup for SCJ](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sector/initiatives/citizens-workgroup-for-singapore-citizenship-journey) to explore, discuss and create content that is being used to update the SCJ.

When everyone from all parts of our society gets involved, that is when integration will be most effective, sustainable and rewarding for Singapore.
