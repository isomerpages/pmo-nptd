With increasing life expectancy and low fertility rates, the proportion of our citizen population aged 65 years and above is fast rising - with large cohorts of “baby boomers” entering the post-65 age range. With increasing longevity, there are opportunities to make Singapore a home for all ages, and a place where we can **grow old with purpose and grace**. 

One of the key efforts by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Promotion Board (HPB) is the National Seniors’ Health Programme in 2015 which seeks to educate older Singaporeans on key health issues, encourage them to adopt healthy living habits, and bring preventive health services to their doorstep. Active Aging Programmes (AAP) also encourage seniors to stay active, healthy and socially engaged. 

Other measures include national support for retirement adequacy and long-term needs, workplace initiatives for those who wish to stay in their jobs for longer, communities of care, and individual opportunities for seniors and their families.
