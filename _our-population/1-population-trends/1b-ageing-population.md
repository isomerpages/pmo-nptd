With increasing life expectancy and low fertility rates, the proportion of our citizen population aged 65 years and above is rising rapidly – with large cohorts of “baby boomers” entering the post-65 age range. Though often viewed as a challenge, greater longevity also brings the promise of additional years in good health, and opportunities for continued learning, active engagement, and contribution to society.

Launched by the Ministerial Committee on Ageing in 2015, the Action Plan for Successful Ageing is our national blueprint to enable Singaporeans to age well and lead active lives, and to build a nation for all ages. The S$3 billion Action Plan encompasses a range of initiatives, at the individual, community and national levels, to provide opportunities for seniors to be meaningfully engaged, be part of a caring and inclusive society, and live well in a city where they can age gracefully and confidently in place.

Good progress has been made over the years, from enhancing workplace longevity by raising the re-employment age, supporting retirement adequacy, and promoting health, learning and volunteering amongst seniors. Other measures have strengthened communities of care, with the nationwide scale up of the Community Networks for Seniors, and support for caregivers and inter-generational harmony. There has also been greater access to aged care services, improved healthcare affordability through the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, and more senior-friendly homes and public infrastructure.

We must continue to redefine ageing as a positive force, give our seniors peace of mind and make Singapore a place where they can age well. We all have a part to play. Together, we can build an inclusive society that celebrates our seniors, and turn silver into gold.
