With increasing life expectancy and low fertility rates, the proportion of Singapore’s citizen population aged 65 years and above is rising rapidly - with large cohorts of “baby boomers” entering the post-65 age range. Though often viewed as a challenge, greater longevity also brings the promise of additional years in good health, and opportunities for continued learning, active engagement, and contribution to society.  

The Action Plan for Successful Ageing is the national blueprint to enable Singaporeans to age well and lead active lives, and to build a nation for all ages. The S$3 billion Action Plan, launched by the Ministerial Committee on Ageing in 2015, encompasses a range of initiatives, at the individual, community and national levels, to provide opportunities for seniors to be meaningfully engaged, be part of a caring and inclusive society, and live well in a city where they can age gracefully and confidently in place.

Good progress has been made over the years, from enhancing workplace longevity by raising the re-employment age, supporting retirement adequacy, and promoting health, learning and volunteering among seniors. Other measures have strengthened communities of care, with the nationwide scale up of the Community Networks for Seniors, and support for caregivers and inter-generational harmony. There has also been greater access to aged care services, improved healthcare affordability through the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, and more senior-friendly homes and public infrastructure.

Ageing must continue to be redefined as a positive force, so that seniors know that Singapore is a place where they can age well in. Everyone can play a part, to build an inclusive society that celebrates seniors in Singapore, and to turn silver into gold.
