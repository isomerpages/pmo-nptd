### Our Sustainable Population Objectives

**People** are Singapore’s only available natural resource, as the late founding Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew once said. **Life expectancy** in Singapore is on the rise. Our seniors are also increasingly healthier and better educated.

Singapore’s resident Total Fertility Rate has remained below the replacement rate of 2.1 for many years. This trend is part of a broader demographic shift in the country. With couples marrying later and having fewer children, the **fertility rate** — the average number of children women will have in their lifetime — has remained low for many years.

Larger cohorts of older Singaporeans are entering their retirement years, while smaller cohorts are entering the workforce. The working age citizen population will gradually decline. There will be fewer working age Singaporeans to drive our economy, and to support seniors who may not be working.

A low fertility rate is hence an existential issue for Singapore. This is why policies are needed to help sustain a **strong and cohesive** society with Singaporeans at its core, a **dynamic and vibrant economy** to provide good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans, and a **high quality living environment** for all.

At the heart of these policies is the desire to make **Singapore a place that is [Made For Families](www.go.gov.sg/madeforfamilies)** — to build a strong ecosystem to support Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood journeys. Singapore takes a comprehensive approach to this, by continually improving measures in in key areas, such as housing, preschool, healthcare, work-life harmony, overall child-raising costs, and physical infrastructure. 

It is also important for Singapore to be a home for all ages, where everyone can live life to the fullest, and **age with purpose and grace**. That is why there are measures implemented across the ecosystem — from national support for retirement adequacy and long-term needs, to workplace initiatives for those who wish to stay in their jobs for longer, to communities of care, to individual opportunities for seniors and their families.

To moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates, and to keep the citizen population stable over the long term, a **carefully** calibrated number of new citizens is taken in each year. New citizenships are granted to individuals who are committed to making Singapore their home. They either share family ties with Singaporeans, or have studied, worked or lived here for some time. 

For Singaporeans who have ventured to live, study or work overseas, there are also efforts to broaden and deepen networks with them through the [Singapore Global Network](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/). 

Singaporeans’ best interests will always be at the core of these policies, not just for now and today, but tomorrow and for future generations of progressive, united Singaporeans.
