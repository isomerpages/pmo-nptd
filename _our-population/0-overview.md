### Our Sustainable Population Objectives

For Singapore to have a sustainable population, policies are needed to build a **strong and cohesive** society with Singaporeans at its core, a **dynamic and vibrant economy** to provide good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans, and a **high quality living environment** for all.

Singapore’s resident Total Fertility Rate<sup>1</sup> has remained below the replacement rate of 2.1 for many years. This trend reflects a broader demographic shift in the country. This trend reflects a broader demographic shift in the country, with couples marrying later and having fewer children.

**Life expectancy** in Singapore is on the rise. Our seniors are also increasingly healthier and better educated. But an **ageing population with low fertility** means that larger groups of older Singaporeans are entering their retirement years, while a smaller number is entering the workforce. The working age citizen population will gradually decline. Consequently, there will be fewer working age Singaporeans to drive the economy, and to support the ageing population.

A low fertility rate is hence an existential issue for Singapore. We aim for a Singapore that is **[Made For Families](https://www.go.gov.sg/madeforfamilies)** — a strong ecosystem that celebrates and supports Singaporeans in every stage of their marriage and parenthood journey. Singapore takes a comprehensive approach to support Singaporeans in achieving their marriage and parenthood aspirations. This includes continually improving measures in areas such as accessible, affordable and quality housing, preschool, healthcare, overall child-raising costs and family-friendly physical infrastructure. Partnerships with the private and people sector are also essential to promote better work-life harmony and social enthusiasm for young children. 

It is also important for Singapore to be a home for all ages, where every Singaporean can live life to the fullest, and **age with purpose and grace**. To do so, there is a range of measures and initiatives by the Government, and the community. This includes national support for retirement adequacy and long-term needs, workplace initiatives for those who wish to stay in their jobs for longer, support networks in the community.

To moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates, and to keep the citizen population stable over the long term, we take in a **carefully calibrated** number of new citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) each year. New citizenships are selectively granted to individuals who are committed to making Singapore their home. Permanent residence is also an intermediate step by which individuals may take up citizenship in Singapore. Many new citizens share family ties with Singaporeans, or have studied, worked or lived here for some time.

Singapore’s population also includes non-residents who are working, studying or living here.  This includes foreign workforce across all pass types, international students, and dependants of citizens. Singapore is fundamentally labour-constrained, and we will need a calibrated number of foreign workers to complement the local workforce. Foreign workers bring with them relevant skills that may be in short supply here. In turn, this helps to attract global investors and create quality jobs for locals. The foreign workforce also augments the labour force in jobs that Singaporean workers may not be keen take up.

As more Singaporeans venture abroad to live, study or work, the [Singapore Global Network](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/) has been established to broaden and deepen networks with them, so that they can stay connected with developments and opportunities with Singapore and Singaporeans around the world. 

When it comes to population matters, the Government remains committed to working with Singaporeans and having their best interests at the heart of its policies. 


_<sup>1</sup> Total Fertility Rate refers to the average number of live-births each female would have during her reproductive years  if she were subject to the prevailing age-specific fertility rates in the population in the given year. The age-specific fertility rate is the number of live-births born to females of a specific age group, out of every thousand females in the same age group.
