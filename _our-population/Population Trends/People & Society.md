<p>A strong and cohesive Singapore society is one that embraces diversity.
Singapore has a rich history of welcoming people of different cultures
and backgrounds; many Singaporeans can trace their ancestry beyond the
country’s shores.</p>
<p>The coexistence and intermixing of cultures continue today. 19% of citizen
marriages last year were inter-ethnic (Chart 8)<sup>[1]</sup>. This proportion
has remained largely stable over the last ten years. Transnational marriages
made up 37% of citizen marriages in 2024 (Chart 9). This proportion has
remained largely stable over the last ten years, barring dips in the COVID
years of 2020 and 2021<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

<p>Immigration helps to moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates
on our citizen population, and keeps the citizen population from shrinking
over the long term. Our PRs and new citizens also add to the vibrancy of
Singapore’s society and economy.</p>
<p>Singapore takes in a carefully controlled number of PRs and new citizens
each year. We are careful to grant citizenships and PRs to individuals
who can contribute to Singapore, integrate well, and are committed to making
Singapore their home. Many of our new citizens and PRs either share family
ties with Singaporeans (for example, through marriage), or have studied,
worked or lived in Singapore for some time.</p>
<p>All new adult citizens come from our pool of PRs, as individuals have
to obtain permanent residency before they may apply for citizenship in
Singapore<sup>[3]</sup>. Our PR population size remains stable at around
half a million, with the majority of our PRs aged between 25 and 59 years
(Chart 10).</p>

<p>We continue to maintain a measured pace of immigration. In 2024, 22,766
individuals were granted citizenship and 35,264 individuals were granted
permanent residency. The average number of citizenships and permanent residencies
granted per year over the last five years (21,300 citizenships and 33,000
permanent residencies) was slightly higher than over the preceding five
years (20,500 citizenships and 31,700 permanent residencies) (Chart 11).</p>

<br><em>The figures are based on the full calendar year (January to December).</em>
<br><em>Note: From 2025, to more accurately reflect immigration inflows and birth statistics, the figures for total number of citizenships granted exclude the category of citizenships by descent. This category is instead included under the <a href="https://www.population.gov.sg/our-population/population-trends/marriage-and-parenthood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Marriage &amp; Parenthood section</a>. Citizenship by descent is based on a constitutional entitlement to citizenship for children born overseas to at least one Singaporean parent, akin to how children born in Singapore to at least one Singaporean parent are constitutionally entitled to citizenship by birth.</em>
</p>
<p>The exact number of PRs and citizenships granted each year depends on
several factors, including the number and quality of applications received
and our changing needs. Various markers of integration are considered,
such as family ties to Singaporeans, length of residency, and whether they
have studied in our national schools or completed National Service. Other
factors considered include the applicant’s economic contributions, qualifications
and age.</p>
<p>It is important for new citizens and PRs to be integrated into our communities.
To help them along, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sectors/resilience-and-engagement/national-integration-council" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Integration Council (NIC)</a>&nbsp;supports
initiatives such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgjourney.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ)</a>,
a collaboration between the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)</a>,
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">People's Association (PA)</a>&nbsp;and
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Immigrations &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA)</a>.
All naturalised citizens go through the SCJ to enrich their understanding
of Singapore’s history, norms and values, and build stronger ties with
the local community. &nbsp;A nation-wide grassroots network of more than
1,500 Integration and Naturalisation Champions (INCs) also helps drive
integration efforts within their local communities.</p>
<p>Our integration efforts seek to create acceptance, mutual understanding
and mutual respect between locals and foreigners. Fostering social integration
and cohesion is a whole-of-society effort; as the newcomers learn and adapt
to local values and norms, we can play our part by reaching out and helping
them understand our local culture and way of life.</p>

<p>[1] Inter-ethnic marriages refer to marriages between persons of different
ethnic groups, namely Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others.</p>
<p>[2] Transnational marriages refer to marriages between a citizen and a
non-citizen (i.e. PR or NR).</p>
<p>[3] The small group of new citizens who were not PRs prior to obtaining
citizenship were minors who were either (i) children of citizens, or (ii)
children of PRs who were included as dependants in their parents’ citizenship
application.</p>
