<p><strong>Marriage and Parenthood Trends</strong>
</p>
<p>There were 22,955 citizen marriages in 2024, 5.7% lower than the 24,355
citizen marriages in 2023, but higher than the 22,165 citizen marriages
in 2019 (pre-COVID) (Chart 3) [1].</p>
<p>The average number of citizen marriages per year in the last five years
(23,000) was slightly lower than that of the preceding five years (23,600).
The median age at first marriage for citizen grooms and brides was 30.8
and 29.1 years in 2024, up from 30.1 and 27.9 years respectively in 2014.</p>

<br><em>The figures are based on the full calendar year (January to December).</em>
<br>
<br>There were 29,237 citizen births in 2024, 1.2% more than the 28,877 citizen
births in 2023 (Chart 4)[2]. The average number of births per year in the
last five years (30,400) was lower than in the preceding five years (32,900).</p>

<br><em>The figures are based on the full calendar year (January to December).</em>
</p>
<p>The resident total fertility rate (TFR), which has been declining over
the past few decades, was 0.97 in 2024, unchanged from 2023 [3]. Many other
advanced societies are also experiencing falling birth rates, as more people
are postponing family formation and having fewer children, as they prioritise
other life goals.</p>
<p>In addition to citizen births in Singapore, there are also children born
overseas to at least one Singaporean parents. In 2024, 1,409 children born
overseas to at least one Singaporean parents were granted citizenship by
descent (Chart 5) [4].</p>

<p><strong>Support for Marriage &amp; Parenthood</strong>
</p>
<p>Marriage and parenthood are ultimately personal decisions, influenced
by a variety of factors including changing social norms and personal priorities.
Our approach has been to foster an environment where Singaporeans continue
to aspire towards marriage and parenthood, and are supported to start,
raise and grow their families.</p>
<p>Young Singaporeans have consistently expressed a strong desire to get
married and have children. From our 2021 Marriage &amp; Parenthood survey,
8 in 10 young singles aspire to get married and have children, and over
9 in 10 married Singaporeans want at least two children. These sentiments
have remained relatively stable since our surveys in 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>Supporting Singaporeans to fulfil their aspirations to marry and have
children continues to be our priority. Through close partnerships across
Government agencies, and with community partners, employers, businesses
and the broader society, a range of support is available to Singaporeans
at every stage of their marriage and parenthood journey. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/mpbooklet" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Marriage &amp; Parenthood Package </a>provides
comprehensive support to help couples start and raise their families. Key
measures in the Package include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Priority housing schemes and grants to help couples own their first home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthcare schemes to defray the costs of assisted conception, maternity
and newborn care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial support through the Baby Bonus scheme, comprising a Cash Gift,
First Step Grant and Government co-matching contributions to the Child
Development Account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large Families Scheme to provide additional support to couples with three
or more children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MediSave Grant for Newborns to defray children’s healthcare expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government-Paid Parental Leave schemes including Maternity Leave, Paternity
Leave, Shared Parental Leave and Childcare Leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsidised infant care and childcare services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government continually reviews and enhances our marriage and parenthood
support in response to feedback gleaned through our surveys and engagements.</p>
<p>Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) doubled from 2 to 4 weeks, on a
voluntary basis, and Unpaid Infant Care Leave has also doubled from 6 to
12 days per parent per year, starting from 1 January 2024. During the 2024
National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has also announced that
the two weeks of voluntary Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) will
be made mandatory from 1 April 2025. A new Shared Parental Leave (SPL)
Scheme will also be implemented in two phases from 1 April 2025, starting
with 6 weeks of parental leave to be shared between both parents from 1
April 2025. This will increase to 10 weeks to be shared between both parents
from 1 April 2026.</p>
<p>In addition, measures are in place to help parents manage their work and
family commitments. For example, the Tripartite Guidelines on FWA Requests
will come into effect on 1 December 2024 to require employers to properly
consider employees’ formal FWA requests, and encourage both sides to have
constructive discussions to work out FWAs that are mutually beneficial.
The Tripartite Standards on Work-Life Harmony and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected
Care Needs were also established in 2021 and 2018 respectively, to highlight
good employment practices that all employers are recommended to implement
at their workplace.</p>

<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">madeforfamilies.gov.sg</a>. Parents may also use the Family Support Calculator
in the LifeSG app, to find out how much benefits they can receive.</p>
<p>Beyond these, we must all do our part to ensure that Singapore is a great
place to start and raise families. The Made For Families initiative was
launched in June 2020 to further assure families of support from the Government
and the broader society, and to encourage more businesses and community
groups to play a part in building a family-friendly environment. Organisations
can submit their request to adopt the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Made For Families</a>&nbsp;brand
mark&nbsp;<a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/about-us/made-for-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>,
to identify themselves as entities promoting the value of family in our
society.</p>
