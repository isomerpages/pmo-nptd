<p><strong>Marriage and Parenthood Trends</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2023, there were 24,355 citizen marriages, 1.7 per cent fewer than
the record high of 24,767 citizen marriages in 2022 (Chart 3)<sup>[1]</sup>,
but higher than the 22,165 citizen marriages in 2019 (pre-COVID).</p>
<p>The average number of citizen marriages per year in the last five years
(22,800) was lower than in the preceding five years (24,000). The median
age at first marriage for citizen grooms and brides was 30.7 and 29.0 years
in 2023, up from 30.1 and 27.8 years respectively in 2013.</p>

30,429 citizen births in 2022 (Chart 4)<sup>[2]</sup>. The average number
of births per year in the last five years (31,100) was also lower than

</p>
<p>The resident total fertility rate (TFR), which has generally been declining
over the past few decades, was 0.97 in 2023<sup>[3]</sup>. The decline
may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in economic
uncertainty and disrupted marriage and parenthood plans for some Singaporean
couples. The decline in TFR is also happening in other advanced societies,
where more people are postponing family formation and having fewer children,
due to reasons such as the prioritisation of careers, shifting attitudes
towards marriage and parenthood, and concerns about child-raising costs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, getting married and having children are personal decisions,
influenced by changing social norms, personal priorities, and economic
sentiments. Young Singaporeans have consistently expressed a strong desire
to get married and have children. From our 2021 Marriage &amp; Parenthood
survey, 8 in 10 young singles aspire to get married and have children,
and over 9 in 10 married Singaporeans want at least 2 children. These sentiments
have held firm since our surveys in 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Support for Marriage &amp; Parenthood</strong>
</p>
<p>Supporting Singaporeans to fulfil their aspirations to marry and have
children continues to be our priority. Through close partnerships across
Government agencies, and with community partners, employers, businesses
and the broader society, a range of support is available to Singaporeans
at every stage of their marriage and parenthood journey. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/mpbooklet" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Marriage &amp; Parenthood Package </a>provides
comprehensive support to help couples start and raise their families. Key
measures in the Package include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Priority housing schemes and grants to help couples own their first home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthcare schemes to defray the costs of assisted conception, maternity
and newborn care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial support through the Baby Bonus scheme, comprising a Cash Gift
and Government co-matching contributions to the Child Development Account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MediSave Grant for Newborns to defray children’s healthcare expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government-Paid Parental Leave schemes including Maternity Leave, Paternity
Leave, and Childcare Leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsidised infant care and childcare services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;As announced at Budget 2023, the Government has increased support
for parents during their children’s early years, by enhancing the Baby
Bonus Cash Gift and Child Development Account contributions. Government-Paid
Paternity Leave (GPPL) doubled from 2 to 4 weeks, on a voluntary basis,
and Unpaid Infant Care Leave has also doubled from 6 to 12 days per parent
per year, starting from 1 January 2024. During the 2024 National Day Rally,
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has also announced that the two weeks of voluntary
Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) will be made mandatory from 1 April
2025. A new Shared Parental Leave (SPL) Scheme will also be implemented
in two phases from 1 April 2025, starting with 6 weeks of parental leave
to be shared between both parents from 1 April 2025. This will increase
to 10 weeks to be shared between both parents from 1 April 2026.</p>
<p>In addition, measures are in place to help parents manage their work and
family commitments. For example, the Tripartite Guidelines on FWA Requests
will come into effect on 1 December 2024 to require employers to properly
consider employees’ formal FWA requests, and encourage both sides to have
constructive discussions to work out FWAs that are mutually beneficial.
The Tripartite Standards on Work-Life Harmony and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected
Care Needs were also established in 2021 and 2018 respectively, to highlight
good employment practices that all employers are recommended to implement
at their workplace.</p>

<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">madeforfamilies.gov.sg</a>. Parents may also use the Family Support Calculator
in the LifeSG app, to find out how much benefits they can receive.</p>
<p>Beyond these, we must all do our part to ensure that Singapore is a great
place to start and raise families. The Made For Families initiative was
launched in June 2020 to further assure families of support from the Government
and the broader society, and to encourage more businesses and community
groups to play a part in building a family-friendly environment. Organisations
can submit their request to adopt the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Made For Families</a>&nbsp;brand
mark&nbsp;<a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/about-us/made-for-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>,
to identify themselves as entities promoting the value of family in our
society.</p>
