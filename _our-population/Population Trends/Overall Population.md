<p>Singapore’s total population stood at 6.11 million as at June 2025 (Diagram
1), a 1.2% increase from June 2023. This increase was mainly due to the
growth in the non-resident population. The annualised population growth
rate of 1.1 per cent over the last five years was slightly higher than
the 0.8 per cent over the preceding five-year period.</p>
<p>This was mostly due to post-COVID growth in the number of Work Permit
Holders in the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors
as companies set about catching up on projects that were delayed by the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The citizen and Permanent Resident (PR) populations increased by 0.7%
(3.61 million to 3.64 million) and 1.2% (538,600 to 544,900) respectively
between June 2023 and June 2024 (Chart 1)<sup>[2]</sup>.

<p>As at June 2024, the Non-Resident (NR) population stood at 1.86 million,
an increase of 5.0% from June 2023. The increase was seen across most pass
types, with Work Permit Holders contributing most to the increase, followed
by Migrant Domestic Workers. Overall, the increase in the NR population
was mainly due to foreign employment growth in Singapore from June 2023
to June 2024 (Chart 2). The NR population is diverse, and its size and
composition fluctuate depending on our economic and social needs. Today,
the foreign workforce makes up about two-thirds of the NR population, while
the remaining one-third comprises mainly migrant domestic workers, dependants,
and students. As Singapore is fundamentally labour constrained, the foreign
workforce complements our local workforce and allows companies to access
a broader range of skills from the global labour pool.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p><em>[1] <u>Singapore residents</u> comprise citizens and PRs.</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Work Permit Holders</u> are semi-skilled non-professionals, managers, executives and technicians (non-PMET) workers from approved source countries. Some work in Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors (e.g. construction workers), and others work in non-CMP sectors (e.g. Services, Manufacturing).</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>S Pass Holders</u> are skilled workers at the associate professionals and technicians (APT) level who earn a salary that is comparable to the top one third of the local APT salaries by age. The minimum qualifying salary starts a $3,150 a month (or $3,650 in the Financial Services sector).</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Employment Pass Holders</u> are foreign PMETs who earn a salary that is comparable to the top one-third of the local PMET salaries by age. The minimum qualifying salary starts at $5,000 a month (or $5,500 in the Financial Services sector). The EP holders are also subject to the Complementarity Assessment (COMPASS) framework when applying for/renewing their passes.</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Long-Term Visit Pass Holders and Dependant’s Pass Holders</u> are mostly dependants of citizens, PRs, and Work Pass Holders.</em>
<br>
<br><em>[2] The basic count and profile of the population are based on a person’s place of usual residence i.e. de jure concept. Therefore, citizens or PRs who have a registered foreign address or have been overseas continuously for 12 months or more prior to the reference date (i.e. June each year) are not counted as part of our citizen and PR population.</em>
<br>
<br><em>[3] To provide a clearer picture of foreign workforce growth related to economic sectors, Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) are excluded from the figures due to the distinct nature of their employment. Unlike other sectors where foreign workers contribute directly to industries such as Construction, Manufacturing and Services, MDWs work in households, performing domestic tasks.</em>
