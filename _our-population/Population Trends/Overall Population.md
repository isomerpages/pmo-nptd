<p>Singapore’s total population stood at 6.11 million as at June 2025 (Diagram
1), a 1.2% increase from June 2024. This increase was mainly due to the
growth in the non-resident population. The annualised population growth
rate over the past five years (2020-2025) was higher than the preceding
five-year period (2015-2020), mostly due to an increase in the number of
Work Permit Holders in the Construction sector to support key infrastructure
projects such as Changi Terminal 5 and the ramping up of housing supply.</p>

<p>The Non-Resident (NR) population is diverse, and its size and composition
fluctuate depending on our economic and social needs. Today, the foreign
workforce makes up about two-thirds of the NR population, while the remaining
one-third comprises mainly Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs), dependants,
and students.</p>
<p>As at June 2025, the NR population stood at 1.91 million, an increase
of 2.7% from June 2024. The increase in the NR population came primarily
from Work Permit Holders, followed by MDWs. The pace of foreign employment
growth in Singapore remained stable from June 2024 to June 2025, compared
to June 2023 to June 2024 (Chart 2).</p>

<hr>
<p><em>[1] <u>Singapore residents</u> comprise SCs and PRs.</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Work Permit Holders</u> are semi-skilled non-professionals, managers, executives and technicians (non-PMET) workers from approved source countries. Some work in Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors (e.g. construction workers), and others work in non-CMP sectors (e.g. Services, Manufacturing).</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>S Pass Holders</u> are skilled workers at the associate professionals and technicians (APT) level who earn a salary that is comparable to the top one third of the local APT salaries by age. The minimum qualifying salary starts a $3,150 a month (or $3,650 in the Financial Services sector).</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Employment Pass Holders</u> are foreign PMETs who earn a salary that is comparable to the top one-third of the local PMET salaries by age. The minimum qualifying salary starts at $5,000 a month (or $5,500 in the Financial Services sector). The EP holders are also subject to the Complementarity Assessment (COMPASS) framework when applying for/renewing their passes.</em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Long-Term Visit Pass Holders and Dependant’s Pass Holders</u> are mostly dependants of citizens, PRs, and Work Pass Holders.</em>
<br>
<br><em>[2] The basic count and profile of the population are based on a person’s place of usual residence i.e. de jure concept. Therefore, citizens or PRs who have a registered foreign address or have been overseas continuously for 12 months or more prior to the reference date (i.e. June each year) are not counted as part of our citizen and PR population.</em>
<br>
<br><em>[3] To provide a clearer picture of foreign workforce growth related to economic sectors, Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) are excluded from the figures due to the distinct nature of their employment. Unlike other sectors where foreign workers contribute directly to industries such as Construction, Manufacturing and Services, MDWs work in households, performing domestic tasks.</em>
