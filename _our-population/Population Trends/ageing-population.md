With increasing life expectancy and low fertility rates, the proportion of Singapore’s citizen population aged 65 years and above is rising rapidly - with large cohorts of “baby boomers” entering the post-65 age range. It is important that we make Singapore a home for all to age with confidence and peace of mind.

The S$3 billion Action Plan for Successful Ageing, launched by the Ministerial Committee on Ageing in 2015, is the national blueprint to enable Singaporeans to age well and lead active lives, and to build a nation for all ages. It encompasses a range of initiatives, at the individual, community, and national levels. It is working towards creating more opportunities for seniors to be meaningfully engaged, be part of a caring and inclusive society, and live well in a city where they can age gracefully and confidently in place.

Good progress has been made over the years. This includes enhancing workplace longevity by raising the re-employment age, supporting retirement adequacy, and promoting health, learning, and volunteering among seniors. Other measures have strengthened communities of care, with the nationwide scale up of the Community Networks for Seniors, and support for caregivers and inter-generational harmony. There has also been greater access to aged care services, improved healthcare affordability through the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, and more senior-friendly homes and public infrastructure.

More recently, the Refresh of the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, and population health efforts, through Healthier SG, aim to empower all Singaporeans to take charge of their health and achieve healthy longevity. With good health, Singaporeans can more readily pursue their aspirations, contribute meaningfully at the workplace or in the community, and remain well connected with their loved ones.

Ageing must continue to be redefined as a positive force, so that this is a place where Singaporeans can age well in. Everyone can play a part, to build an inclusive society that celebrates seniors in Singapore, and to turn silver into gold.
