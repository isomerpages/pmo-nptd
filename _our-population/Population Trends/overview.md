Singapore’s total population stood at 5.64 million as at June 2022 (Diagram 1). The total population grew by 3.4% from June 2021 to June 2022, but remained slightly lower than the pre-COVID level of 5.70 million in June 2019.

The citizen and PR populations decreased by 0.7 per cent (3.52 million to 3.50 million) and 6.2 per cent (0.52 million to 0.49 million) respectively between June 2020 and June 2021 (Chart 1). This was mainly because more citizens and PRs remained overseas continuously for 12 months or more due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and were therefore not counted as part of our population.

The non-resident population decreased by 10.7 per cent, to 1.47 million as of June 2021. This was because of a decrease in foreign employment in Singapore from June 2020 to June 2021 due to travel restrictions and uncertain economic conditions (Chart 2). The decrease was seen across all pass types, with the largest drop in Work Permit Holders in the Construction, Marine Shipyard, and Process sectors.

With increasing life expectancy and low fertility rates, the proportion of Singapore’s citizen population aged 65 and above is rising (Chart 3). This proportion has increased from 10.4 per cent in 2011 to 17.6 per cent in 2021, and is expected to increase to about 23.8 per cent in 2030.

*The 2030 numbers are meant to illustrate the possible change in the population that could occur if certain demographic assumptions prevail over the stated period. These assumptions may or may not be realised.*

In 2020, there were 19,430 citizen marriages, 12.3 per cent fewer than the 22,165 citizen marriages in 2019. COVID-19 restrictions on large gatherings could have led couples to defer their marriages (Chart 4).

There were 31,816 citizen births in 2020, fewer than the 32,844 citizen births in 2019. Over the last five years (2016-2020), there were about 32,500 citizen births on average each year, slightly more than the average of 32,400 each year in the preceding five-year period (2011 to 2015, Chart 5).

However, resident Total Fertility Rate remained below the replacement rate of 2.1 at 1.14 in 2019, which is the same as the year before. This is partly due to later marriages and childbearing. The median age of first-time mothers increased from 28.5 years in 2000, to 30.6 years in 2019.

These figures are from the annual [Population in Brief](/media-centre/publications/population-in-brief) publication, which provides key updates and trends on Singapore’s population.
