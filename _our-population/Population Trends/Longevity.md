<p>The proportion of our citizen population aged 65 years and above is rising,
and at a faster pace compared to the last decade. Large cohorts of “baby
boomers” have begun entering the post-65 age range (Chart 5)<sup>[1]</sup>.
In June 2024, 60.4 per cent of citizens were aged 20-64 years. This proportion
decreased from 64.8 per cent in 2014. Conversely, the proportion of citizens
aged 65 and above increased from 12.4 per cent in 2014 to 19.9 per cent
in 2024. By 2030, around 1 in 4 citizens (24.1 per cent) will be aged 65
and above (Chart 6).</p>

<br>Given these trends, it is important that we make Singapore a home for
all to age with confidence and peace of mind.</p>
<p>The S$3 billion Action Plan for Successful Ageing, launched by the Ministerial
Committee on Ageing in 2015, is the national blueprint to enable Singaporeans
to age well and lead active lives, and to build a nation for all ages.
It encompasses a range of initiatives, at the individual, community, and
national levels. It is working towards creating more opportunities for
seniors to be meaningfully engaged, be part of a caring and inclusive society,
and live well in a city where they can age gracefully and confidently in
place.</p>
<p>Good progress has been made over the years. This includes enhancing workplace
longevity by raising the re-employment age, supporting retirement adequacy,
and promoting health, learning, and volunteering among seniors. Other measures
include strengthening support for caregivers and fostering inter-generational
harmony. There has also been greater access to aged care services, improved
healthcare affordability through the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages,
and more senior-friendly homes and public infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Refresh of the Action Plan for Successful Ageing was launched in 2023,
and population health efforts, through Healthier SG, aim to empower all
Singaporeans to take charge of their health and achieve healthy longevity.
With good health, Singaporeans can more readily pursue their aspirations,
contribute meaningfully at the workplace or in the community, and remain
well connected with their loved ones.</p>
<p>To support healthy longevity in homes and communities, Age Well SG was
launched in 2023. This programme aims to tackle social isolation as one
of the key determinants of frailty and support seniors to age actively,
stay socially connected, and be cared for within their communities.
<br>
<br>Ageing must continue to be redefined as a positive force, so that Singapore
remains a place where Singaporeans can age well in. Everyone can play a
part, to build an inclusive society that celebrates seniors in Singapore,
and to turn silver into gold.

<p>[1] “Baby boomers” are defined as those born from 1946 to 1964. As such,
they would be aged between 50 and 68 in 2014, and 60 and 78 in 2024.</p>
<p>[2] The 2030 numbers illustrate the possible change in the population
that could occur if certain demographic assumptions prevail over the stated
period. These assumptions may or may not be realised.</p>
