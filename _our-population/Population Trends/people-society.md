<p>A strong and cohesive Singapore society is one that embraces diversity.
Singapore has a rich history of welcoming people of different cultures
and backgrounds; many Singaporeans can trace their ancestry beyond the
country’s shores.</p>
<p>The coexistence and intermixing of cultures continue today. About 1 in
6 citizen marriages last year were inter-ethnic<sup> </sup>(Chart 7)
<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This proportion has remained largely stable in the last ten years.
In the past decade, more than one-third of citizen marriages every year
were transnational marriages. The proportion of transnational marriages
dipped in 2020 and 2021, likely due to COVID-related travel restrictions,
but has since increased. Transnational marriages made up 36% of citizen
marriages in 2023, similar to the pre-COVID proportion of 37% in 2019 (Chart
8)<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Immigration helps to moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates
on our citizen population, and keeps it from shrinking over the longer
term. Singapore takes in a carefully controlled number of Permanent Residents
(PRs) and new citizens each year. New citizenships are granted to individuals
who can integrate and contribute to Singapore, and are committed to making
Singapore their home. New citizens either share family ties with Singaporeans
(for example, through marriage), or have studied, worked or lived in Singapore
for some time. The total number of citizenships granted each year also
includes those granted to children born overseas to Singaporean parents
(“citizens by descent”).</p>
<p>All new adult citizens come from our pool of PRs, as individuals have
to obtain permanent residency before they may apply for citizenship in
Singapore. The small group of new citizens who were not PRs prior to obtaining
citizenship were minors who were either (i) children of citizens, including
citizens by descent, or (ii) children of PRs who were included as dependants
in their parents’ citizenship application. Singapore has kept the PR population
size stable at around half a million, and the majority of our PRs are aged
between 25 and 59 years (Chart 9).</p>

<p>The pace of immigration continues to be measured and stable. In 2023,
23,472 individuals were granted citizenship and 34,491 individuals were
granted permanent residency. About 5.7% of the new citizens, or 1,332 of
them, were children born overseas to Singaporean parents (“citizens by
descent”)(Chart 10). The average number of new citizenships and permanent
residencies granted per year over the last five years (22,400 citizenships
and 32,600 permanent residencies) was slightly higher than over the preceding
five years (21,600 citizenships and 31,100 permanent residencies).</p>

</p>
<p>The exact number of new citizenships and permanent residencies granted
each year depends on several factors such as the number and quality of
applications received. Each application for citizenship and permanent residency
is evaluated holistically to assess the applicant’s ability to contribute
and integrate in Singapore, and their commitment to sinking roots here.
Various markers of integration are considered, such as family ties to Singaporeans,
length of residency, and whether they have studied in our national schools
or completed National Service. Other factors considered include the applicant’s
economic contributions, qualifications and age.</p>
<p>Newcomers should make the effort to adapt to local norms. To help them
along, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sector/initiatives/national-integration-council" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">National Integration Council (NIC)</a>&nbsp;supports
initiatives such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgjourney.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ)</a>,
a collaboration between the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)</a>,
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">People's Association (PA)</a>&nbsp;and
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Immigrations &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA)</a>.
All naturalised citizens go through the SCJ to enrich their understanding
of Singapore’s history, norms and values, and build stronger ties with
the community. Singaporeans were invited to join the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sector/initiatives/citizens-workgroup-for-singapore-citizenship-journey" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Citizen's Workshop for SCJ</a>&nbsp;to
explore, discuss and create content that is being used to update the SCJ.</p>
<p>Our integration efforts seek to create acceptance, mutual understanding
and mutual respect between locals and foreigners. Fostering social integration
and cohesion is a whole-of-society effort; as the newcomers learn and adapt
to local values and norms, we can play our part by reaching out and helping
them understand our local culture and way of life.</p>
