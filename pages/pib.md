### **Population in Brief 2019: What do you need to know?**

Population in Brief (PIB) 2019 has just been released, and provides key updates and trends on Singapore’s population, including citizen marriages, births and immigration. Here’s a snapshot of what the key trends are:  
  
**1. Citizen marriages**

In 2018, there were 23,632 citizen marriages, compared to the 24,417 citizen marriages in 2017. Over the last five years (2014 to 2018), there were about 24,000 citizen marriages on average each year, higher than the average of 21,900 each year in the previous five years (2009 to 2013).

**2. Citizen births**

There were 32,413 citizen births in 2018, compared to the 32,356 citizen births in 2017. Over the last five years (2014 to 2018), there were about 33,000 citizen births on average each year, higher than the average of 31,400 each year in the previous five years (2009 to 2013). The resident total fertility rate fell from 1.16 in 2017 to 1.14 in 2018.

Citizen ever-married females have fewer children on average compared to a decade ago, but most still have two or more children.  
  
**3. Overall population**

The citizen population grew by 0.8%, to reach 3.50 million citizens as of Jun 2019. The citizen population continues to age, with 16.0% aged 65 and above compared with 15.2% last year. The permanent resident population remained relatively stable at 0.53 million as of Jun 2019.

The non-resident population grew by 2.0%, to reach 1.68 million as of Jun 2019. This was mainly attributed to foreign employment growth due to sustained growth in Services and the turnaround in Construction. By pass type, foreign employment growth was mainly driven by an increase in Work Permit Holders.

Overall, Singapore’s total population stands at 5.70 million as of Jun 2019. The total population grew by 1.2% from Jun 2018 to Jun 2019.
