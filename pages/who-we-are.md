The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) was established on 1 January 2011 under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It drives the formulation, coordination, and review of Government policies related to population and talent, for a sustainable population for Singapore. This is so as to build a strong and cohesive society with Singaporeans at its heart, a dynamic and vibrant economy to provide good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans, and a high quality living environment. 

On 1 Aug 2016, NPTD was brought under the Strategy Group in the Prime Minister's Office to further drive strategic alignment on population and talent policies across Government.

NPTD comprises two Directorates:  
* The Population Policy & Planning Directorate (PPD) leads and coordinates Whole-of-Government efforts to tackle challenges, and to seize opportunities for Singapore’s current and future population. The team conducts policy reviews and research to drive and coordinate Singapore’s immediate and longer term population strategies. 

* The Marriage & Parenthood Policy Directorate (MPPD) leads and coordinates Whole-of-Government efforts to support marriages and births in Singapore. The team formulates and reviews policies, informed by research and data analyses, to build a Singapore that is Made for Families.
