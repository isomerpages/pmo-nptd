The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) was established on 1 January 2011 under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). NPTD drives the formulation, coordination, and review of Government policies in support of our sustainable population objectives. Our aim is to build a strong and cohesive society, a dynamic and vibrant economy to provide good jobs and opportunities, as well as a high quality living environment and home for all Singaporeans.

On 1 August 2016, NPTD was brought under the Strategy Group in the Prime Minister’s Office, to further drive strategic alignment on population and talent policies across Government.

NPTD comprises two Directorates:  
* The Population Policy & Planning Directorate (PPD) leads and organises efforts across Government to tackle challenges and seize opportunities for Singapore’s current and future population. The team analyses data, conducts research, reviews and formulates policies to support Singapore’s immediate and longer-term population strategies.

* The Marriage & Parenthood Policy Directorate (MPPD) leads and coordinates efforts across Government to support marriages and births in Singapore. The team analyses data, conducts research, reviews and formulates policies to build a Singapore that is Made for Families.
