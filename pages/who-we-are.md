The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) was established on 1 January 2011 under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It drives the formulation, coordination, and review of Government policies related to population and talent, to achieve a sustainable population for Singapore. On 1 Aug 2016, NPTD was brought under Strategy Group which supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to establish national priorities, and strengthen strategic alignment across Government. 

NPTD comprises two Directorates:  
* The Population Policy & Planning Directorate (PPD) leads and coordinates Whole-of-Government efforts to tackle challenges, and seize opportunities associated with Singapore’s current and future population. The team conducts policy reviews and research to drive and coordinate Singapore’s immediate and longer term population strategies. 

* The Marriage & Parenthood Policy Directorate (MPPD) leads and coordinates Whole-of-Government efforts to support marriages and births in Singapore. The team formulates and reviews policies, informed by research and data analyses, to foster a more family-friendly Singapore.
