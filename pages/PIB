Over the last five years (2014 to 2018), there were about 24,000 citizen marriages on average each year, 
higher than the average of 21,900 each year in the previous five years (2009 to 2013).

## **2. Citizen births**
There were 32,413 citizen births in 2018, compared to the 32,356 citizen births in 2017. Over the last five years (2014 to 2018), there were about 33,000 citizen births on average each year,
