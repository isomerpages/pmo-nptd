### **About NPTD**

The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) was established on 1 January 2011 under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It strives to achieve a sustainable population for Singapore by driving the formulation, coordination and review of Government policies related to population and talent. On 1 Aug 2016, NPTD was brought under Strategy Group which supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to establish national priorities and strengthen strategic alignment across Government. 

### **Overview of NPTD's work**

NPTD comprises two Directorates. The Population Policy & Planning Directorate (PPD) leads and coordinates Whole-of-Government efforts to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities associated with Singapore’s current and future population. The team’s specific tasks include policy reviews, population planning/projections, and policy research to drive and coordinate Singapore’s immediate and longer term population strategies. 

The Marriage & Parenthood Policy Directorate (MPPD) leads and coordinates Whole-of-Government efforts to support marriages and births in Singapore. The team formulates and reviews policies, informed by research and data analyses, to foster a more family-friendly Singapore.
