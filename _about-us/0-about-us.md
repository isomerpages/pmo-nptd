### **About NPTD**
The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) was established on 1 January 2011 under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office (PMO). It strives to achieve a sustainable population for Singapore through driving the formulation, coordination and review of Government policies related to population and talent. From 1 Aug 2016, NPTD was brought under Strategy Group which supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to establish priorities and strengthen strategic alignment across Government.
